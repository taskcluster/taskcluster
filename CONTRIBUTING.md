# How to Contribute

We welcome pull requests from everyone. We do expect everyone to adhere to the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines][participation].

If you're trying to figure out what to work on, here are some places to find suitable projects: 
* [Good first bugs][goodfirstbug]: these are scoped to make it easy for first-time contributors to get their feet wet with Taskcluster code.
* [Mentored bugs][bugsahoy]: these are slightly more involved projects that may require insight or guidance from someone on the Taskcluster team.
* [Full list of open issues][issues]: everything else

If the project you're interested in working on isn't covered by a bug or issue, or you're unsure about how to proceed on an existing issue, it's a good idea to talk to someone on the Taskcluster team before you go too far down a particular path. You can find us in the #taskcluster channel on [Mozilla's IRC server][irc] to discuss. You can also simply add a comment to the issue or bug.

Once you've found an issue to work on and written a patch, submit a pull request. Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Check out our [development processes][developmentprocesses].
* Follow our [best practices][bestpractices].
* This includes [writing or updating tests][testing].
* Write a [good commit message][commit].

Welcome to the team!

Note that we use [all-contributors][all-contributors] to make sure everyone gets credit for their work on Taskcluster.
You can add new people to the list using the [@all-contributors bot][all-contributors-bot]
