description: get correct number of claimed tasks for a task queue
methods:
  queue_claimed_tasks_count:
    description: |
      Count the number of claimed tasks for given task queue.
      Because queue_claimed_tasks table might have several records for the same task-run
      when the task is being reclaimed, we count distinct (task_id, run_id)
    mode: read
    serviceName: queue
    args: task_queue_id_in text
    returns: integer
    body: |-
      begin
        return (
          select count(distinct (task_id, run_id))
          from queue_claimed_tasks
          where task_queue_id = task_queue_id_in
            and taken_until > now()
        );
      end

  queue_worker_stats:
    description: |
      Retrieve comprehensive statistics for task queues including worker counts,
      quarantined workers, claimed tasks, and pending tasks. This method performs
      a full outer join across queue_workers, queue_claimed_tasks, and
      queue_pending_tasks tables to provide a unified view of queue metrics.

      Returns one row per task_queue_id with the following metrics:
      - worker_count: Total number of active workers (not expired)
      - quarantined_count: Number of workers currently under quarantine
      - claimed_count: Number of distinct tasks currently claimed by workers
      - pending_count: Number of distinct tasks waiting to be claimed

      All counts default to 0 when no data exists for a given metric.

      Updated from 112 version to increase distinct performance
