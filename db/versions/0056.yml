      Create an object record ready for upload.
      
      This method is idempotent, and will succeed if called multiple times with
      the same parameters, as long as `upload_id` is still set (that is, until
      the upload is completed).  Otherwise it will raise a UNIQUE_VIOLATION
      exception.  `upload_expires_in` is excluded from this comparison.
