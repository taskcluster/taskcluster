      Update API-accessible columns on an existig worker pool.  All fields are
      overridden, but if the provider_id changes, then the existing provider_id
      is added to previous_provider_ids.  The return value contains values
      required for an API response and previous_provider_id (singular) containing
      the provider_id found before the update.  If no such worker pool exists,
      the return value is an empty set.
