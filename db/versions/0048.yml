      Get existing workers (without their `provider_data`) filtered by the optional arguments,
      ordered by `worker_pool_id`, `worker_group`, and  `worker_id`.
      If the pagination arguments are both NULL, all rows are returned.
      Otherwise, page_size rows are returned at offset page_offset.
