    description: |-
      Get non-stopped workers filtered by the optional arguments,
      ordered by `worker_pool_id`, `worker_group`, and  `worker_id`.
      If the pagination arguments are both NULL, all rows are returned.
      Otherwise, page_size rows are returned at offset `page_offset`.
      The `quaratine_until` contains NULL or a date in the past if the
      worker is not quarantined, otherwise the date until which it is
      quaratined.
