           `claim-expired`,
         * Refresh temporary credentials used for processing the task, and
         * Abort execution if the task/run have been resolved.

        If the `takenUntil` timestamp is exceeded the queue will resolve the run
        as _exception_ with reason `claim-expired`, and proceeded to retry to the
        task. This ensures that tasks are retried, even if workers disappear
        without warning.

        Create Artifact

        This API end-point creates an artifact for a specific run of a task. This
        should **only** be used by a worker currently operating on this task, or
        from a process running within the task (ie. on the worker).

        All artifacts must specify when they `expires`, the queue will
        automatically take care of deleting artifacts past their
        expiration point. This features makes it feasible to upload large
        intermediate artifacts from data processing applications, as the
        artifacts can be set to expire a few days later.

        We currently support 4 different `storageType`s, each storage type have
        slightly different features and in some cases difference semantics.

        **S3 artifacts**, is useful for static files which will be stored on S3.
        When creating an S3 artifact the queue will return a pre-signed URL
        to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your artifact. Note
        that `PUT` request **must** specify the `content-length` header and
        **must** give the `content-type` header the same value as in the request
        to `createArtifact`.

        **Azure artifacts**, are stored in _Azure Blob Storage_ service, which
        given the consistency guarantees and API interface offered by Azure is
        more suitable for artifacts that will be modified during the execution
        of the task. For example docker-worker has a feature that persists the
        task log to Azure Blob Storage every few seconds creating a somewhat
        live log. A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL
        featuring a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),
        refer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.
        **Warning: azure artifact is currently an experimental feature subject
        to changes and data-drops.**

        **Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
        store for you. These artifacts really only have a `url` property and
        when the artifact is requested the client will be redirect the URL
        provided with a `303` (See Other) redirect. Please note that we cannot
        delete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the
        reference to the artifact, when it expires.

        **Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
        store for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the
        worker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you
        would otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an
        error artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or
        turns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will
        get a `403` (Forbidden) response. This is mainly designed to ensure that
        dependent tasks can distinguish between artifacts that were suppose to
        be generated and artifacts for which the name is misspelled.

        **Artifact immutability**, generally speaking you cannot overwrite an
        artifact when created. But if you repeat the request with the same
        properties the request will succeed as the operation is idempotent.
        This is useful if you need to refresh a signed URL while uploading.
        Do not abuse this to overwrite artifacts created by another entity!
        Such as worker-host overwriting artifact created by worker-code.

        As a special case the `url` property on _reference artifacts_ can be
        updated. You should only use this to update the `url` property for
        reference artifacts your process has created.

        Get an approximate number of pending tasks for the given `provisionerId`
        and `workerType`.

        The underlying Azure Storage Queues only promises to give us an estimate.
        Furthermore, we cache the result in memory for 20 seconds. So consumers
        should be no means expect this to be an accurate number.
        It is, however, a solid estimate of the number of pending tasks.
