This API can also perform basic instance\nmanagement tasks in addition to maintaining the internal state of worker type\nconfiguration information.\n\nThe Provisioner runs at a configurable interval.  Each iteration of the\nprovisioner fetches a current copy the state that the AWS EC2 api reports.  In\neach iteration, we ask the Queue how many tasks are pending for that worker\ntype.  Based on the number of tasks pending and the scaling ratio, we may\nsubmit requests for new instances.  We use pricing information, capacity and\nutility factor information to decide which instance type in which region would\nbe the optimal configuration.\n\nEach EC2 instance type will declare a capacity and utility factor.  Capacity is\nthe number of tasks that a given machine is capable of running concurrently.\nUtility factor is a relative measure of performance between two instance types.\nWe multiply the utility factor by the spot price to compare instance types and\nregions when making the bidding choices.\n\nWhen a new EC2 instance is instantiated, its user data contains a token in\n`securityToken` that can be used with the `getSecret` method to retrieve\nthe worker's credentials and any needed passwords or other restricted\ninformation.  The worker is responsible for deleting the secret after\nretrieving it, to prevent dissemination of the secret to other proceses\nwhich can read the instance user data.\n",

      "description": "The task index, typically available at `index.taskcluster.net`, is\nresponsible for indexing tasks. In order to ensure that tasks can be\nlocated by recency and/or arbitrary strings. Common use-cases includes\n\n * Locate tasks by git or mercurial `<revision>`, or\n * Locate latest task from given `<branch>`, such as a release.\n\n**Index hierarchy**, tasks are indexed in a dot `.` separated hierarchy\ncalled a namespace. For example a task could be indexed in\n`<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. In this case the following\nnamespaces is created.\n\n 1. `<revision>`, and,\n 2. `<revision>.linux-64`\n\nThe inside the namespace `<revision>` you can find the namespace\n`<revision>.linux-64` inside which you can find the indexed task\n`<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. In this example you'll be able to\nfind build for a given revision.\n\n**Task Rank**, when a task is indexed, it is assigned a `rank` (defaults\nto `0`). If another task is already indexed in the same namespace with\nthe same lower or equal `rank`, the task will be overwritten. For example\nconsider a task indexed as `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`, in\nthis case on might choose to use a unix timestamp or mercurial revision\nnumber as `rank`. This way the latest completed linux 64 bit release\nbuild is always available at `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`.\n\n**Indexed Data**, when a task is located in the index you will get the\n`taskId` and an additional user-defined JSON blob that was indexed with\ntask. You can use this to store additional information you would like to\nget additional from the index.\n\n**Entry Expiration**, all indexed entries must have an expiration date.\nTypically this defaults to one year, if not specified. If you are\nindexing tasks to make it easy to find artifacts, consider using the\nexpiration date that the artifacts is assigned.\n\n**Valid Characters**, all keys in a namespace `<key1>.<key2>` must be\nin the form `/[a-zA-Z0-9_!~*'()%-]+/`. Observe that this is URL-safe and\nthat if you strictly want to put another character you can URL encode it.\n\n**Indexing Routes**, tasks can be indexed using the API below, but the\nmost common way to index tasks is adding a custom route on the following\nform `index.<namespace>`. In-order to add this route to a task you'll\nneed the following scope `queue:route:index.<namespace>`. When a task has\nthis route, it'll be indexed when the task is **completed successfully**.\nThe task will be indexed with `rank`, `data` and `expires` as specified\nin `task.extra.index`, see example below:\n\n```js\n{\n  payload:  { /* ... */ },\n  routes: [\n    // index.<namespace> prefixed routes, tasks CC'ed such a route will\n    // be indexed under the given <namespace>\n    \"index.mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build\",\n    \"index.<revision>.linux-64.release-build\"\n  ],\n  extra: {\n    // Optional details for indexing service\n    index: {\n      // Ordering, this taskId will overwrite any thing that has\n      // rank <= 4000 (defaults to zero)\n      rank:       4000,\n\n      // Specify when the entries expires (Defaults to 1 year)\n      expires:          new Date().toJSON(),\n\n      // A little informal data to store along with taskId\n      // (less 16 kb when encoded as JSON)\n      data: {\n        hgRevision:   \"...\",\n        commitMessae: \"...\",\n        whatever...\n      }\n    },\n    // Extra properties for other services...\n  }\n  // Other task properties...\n}\n```\n\n**Remark**, when indexing tasks using custom routes, it's also possible\nto listen for messages about these tasks. Which is quite convenient, for\nexample one could bind to `route.index.mozilla-central.*.release-build`,\nand pick up all messages about release builds. Hence, it is a\ngood idea to document task index hierarchies, as these make up extension\npoints in their own.",

A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL\nfeaturing a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),\nrefer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.\n**Warning: azure artifact is currently an experimental feature subject\nto changes and data-drops.**\n\n**Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts really only have a `url` property and\nwhen the artifact is requested the client will be redirect the URL\nprovided with a `303` (See Other) redirect. Please note that we cannot\ndelete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the\nreference to the artifact, when it expires.\n\n**Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the\nworker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you\nwould otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an\nerror artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or\nturns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will\nget a `403` (Forbidden) response. This is mainly designed to ensure that\ndependent tasks can distinguish between artifacts that were suppose to\nbe generated and artifacts for which the name is misspelled.\n\n**Artifact immutability**, generally speaking you cannot overwrite an\nartifact when created. But if you repeat the request with the same\nproperties the request will succeed as the operation is idempotent.\nThis is useful if you need to refresh a signed URL while uploading.\nDo not abuse this to overwrite artifacts created by another entity!\nSuch as worker-host overwriting artifact created by worker-code.\n\nAs a special case the `url` property on _reference artifacts_ can be\nupdated. You should only use this to update the `url` property for\nreference artifacts your process has created.",

      "description": "The queue, typically available at `queue.taskcluster.net`, is responsible\nfor accepting tasks and track their state as they are executed by\nworkers. In order ensure they are eventually resolved.\n\nThis document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows\nthird-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.\nThese exchanges targets the following audience:\n * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,\n * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),\n * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.\n\nYou'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same\nrouting key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages\nabout a certain kind tasks.\n\n**Task-graphs**, if the task-graph scheduler, documented elsewhere, is\nused to schedule a task-graph, the task submitted will have their\n`schedulerId` set to `'task-graph-scheduler'`, and their `taskGroupId` to\nthe `taskGraphId` as given to the task-graph scheduler. This is useful if\nyou wish to listen for all messages in a specific task-graph.\n\n**Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using\nthe `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details\non permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has\nthe entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in\n`task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the\nrouting-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.\n\nThese routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere\nwith the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the\n_primary_ routing key is alwasys prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured\nin the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.\n\nPlease, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive\nin your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with\nmultiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing\nrouting keys.\n\n**Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,\nwhich means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests\nwill ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.\nThis is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but\nwhen re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend\nany related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.\n\nThis shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using\nconfirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,\nthis only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.\n\n**Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the\nserver crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the\nfuture. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us\nif this corner case is of concern to you.",

You just specify the `taskId` in the list of `required` tasks.\nSee the example below, where the second task requires the first task.\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  tasks: [\n    {\n      taskId:     \"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\",\n      requires:   [],\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      taskId:     \"73GsfK62QNKAk2Hg1EEZTQ\",\n      requires:   [\"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\"],\n      task: {\n        payload: {\n          env: {\n            DEPENDS_ON:  \"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\"\n          }\n          ...\n        }\n        ...\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**The `schedulerId` property**, defaults to the `schedulerId` of this\nscheduler in production that is `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`. This\nproperty must be either undefined or set to `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`,\notherwise the task-graph will be rejected.\n\n**The `taskGroupId` property**, defaults to the `taskGraphId` of the\ntask-graph submitted, and if provided much be the `taskGraphId` of\nthe task-graph. Otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.\n\n**Task-graph scopes**, a task-graph is assigned a set of scopes, just\nlike tasks. Tasks within a task-graph cannot have scopes beyond those\nthe task-graph has. The task-graph scheduler will execute all requests\non behalf of a task-graph using the set of scopes assigned to the\ntask-graph. Thus, if you are submitting tasks to `my-worker-type` under\n`my-provisioner` it's important that your task-graph has the scope\nrequired to define tasks for this `provisionerId` and `workerType`.\nSee the queue for details on permissions required. Note, the task-graph\ndoes not require permissions to schedule the tasks. This is done with\nscopes provided by the task-graph scheduler.\n\n**Task-graph specific routing-keys**, using the `taskGraph.routes`\nproperty you may define task-graph specific routing-keys. If a task-graph\nhas a task-graph specific routing-key: `<route>`, then the poster will\nbe required to posses the scope `scheduler:route:<route>`. And when the\nan AMQP message about the task-graph is published the message will be\nCC'ed with the routing-key: `route.<route>`. This is useful if you want\nanother component to listen for completed tasks you have posted.",

These exchanges targets the following audience:\n * Reporters, who displays the state of task-graphs or emails people on\n   failures, and\n * End-users, who wants notification of completed task-graphs\n\n**Remark**, the task-graph scheduler will require that the `schedulerId`\nfor tasks is set to the `schedulerId` for the task-graph scheduler. In\nproduction the `schedulerId` is typically `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`.\nFurthermore, the task-graph scheduler will also require that\n`taskGroupId` is equal to the `taskGraphId`.\n\nCombined these requirements ensures that `schedulerId` and `taskGroupId`\nhave the same position in the routing keys for the queue exchanges.\nSee queue documentation for details on queue exchanges. Hence, making\nit easy to listen for all tasks in a given task-graph.\n\nNote that routing key entries 2 through 7 used for exchanges on the\ntask-graph scheduler is hardcoded to `_`.
