    The task-graph scheduler, typically available at

    scheduling tasks for evaluation by the queue as their dependencies are
    satisfied.

    This document describes API end-points offered by the task-graph
    scheduler. These end-points targets the following audience:
     * Post-commit hooks, that wants to submit task-graphs for testing,
     * End-users, who wants to execute a set of dependent tasks, and
     * Tools, that wants to inspect the state of a task-graph.

        Create new task-graph

        Create a new task-graph, the `status` of the resulting JSON is a
        task-graph status structure, you can find the `taskGraphId` in this
        structure.

        **Referencing required tasks**, it is possible to reference other tasks
        in the task-graph that must be completed successfully before a task is
        scheduled. You just specify the `taskId` in the list of `required` tasks.
        See the example below, where the second task requires the first task.
        ```
        {
          ...
          tasks: [
            {
              taskId:     "XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA",
              requires:   [],
              ...
            },
            {
              taskId:     "73GsfK62QNKAk2Hg1EEZTQ",
              requires:   ["XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA"],
              task: {
                payload: {
                  env: {
                    DEPENDS_ON:  "XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA"
                  }
                  ...
                }
                ...
              },
              ...
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        **The `schedulerId` property**, defaults to the `schedulerId` of this
        scheduler in production that is `"task-graph-scheduler"`. This
        property must be either undefined or set to `"task-graph-scheduler"`,
        otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.

        **The `taskGroupId` property**, defaults to the `taskGraphId` of the
        task-graph submitted, and if provided much be the `taskGraphId` of
        the task-graph. Otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.

        **Task-graph scopes**, a task-graph is assigned a set of scopes, just
        like tasks. Tasks within a task-graph cannot have scopes beyond those
        the task-graph has. The task-graph scheduler will execute all requests
        on behalf of a task-graph using the set of scopes assigned to the
        task-graph. Thus, if you are submitting tasks to `my-worker-type` under
        `my-provisioner` it's important that your task-graph has the scope
        required to define tasks for this `provisionerId` and `workerType`.
        (`queue:define-task:..` or `queue:create-task:..`; see the queue for
        details on scopes required). Note, the task-graph does not require
        permissions to schedule the tasks (`queue:schedule-task:..`), as this is
        done with scopes provided by the task-graph scheduler.

        **Task-graph specific routing-keys**, using the `taskGraph.routes`
        property you may define task-graph specific routing-keys. If a task-graph
        has a task-graph specific routing-key: `<route>`, then the poster will
        be required to posses the scope `scheduler:route:<route>`. And when the
        an AMQP message about the task-graph is published the message will be
        CC'ed with the routing-key: `route.<route>`. This is useful if you want
        another component to listen for completed tasks you have posted.

        Extend existing task-graph

        Add a set of tasks to an existing task-graph. The request format is very
        similar to the request format for creating task-graphs. But `routes`
        key, `scopes`, `metadata` and `tags` cannot be modified.

        **Referencing required tasks**, just as when task-graphs are created,
        each task has a list of required tasks. It is possible to reference
        all `taskId`s within the task-graph.

        **Safety,** it is only _safe_ to call this API end-point while the
        task-graph being modified is still running. If the task-graph is
