generic-worker is a taskcluster worker that can run on any platform that supports go (golang).
See http://taskcluster.github.io/generic-worker/ for more details. Essentially, the worker is
the taskcluster component that executes tasks. It requests tasks from the taskcluster queue,
and reports back results to the queue.

  Usage:
    generic-worker run                      [--config         CONFIG-FILE]
                                            [--with-worker-runner]
                                            [--worker-runner-protocol-pipe PIPE]` + installServiceSummary() + `

    generic-worker --version

  Targets:
    run                                     Runs the generic-worker.  Pass --with-worker-runner if
                                            running under that service, otherwise generic-worker will
                                            not communicate with worker-runner.
    show-payload-schema                     Each taskcluster task defines a payload to be
                                            interpreted by the worker that executes it. This
                                            payload is validated against a json schema baked
                                            into the release. This option outputs the json
                                            schema used in this version of the generic
                                            worker.` + installService() + `

  Configuring the generic worker:

    The configuration file for the generic worker is specified with -c|--config CONFIG-FILE
    as described above. Its format is a json dictionary of name/value pairs.

        ** REQUIRED ** properties
        =========================

          accessToken                       Taskcluster access token used by generic worker
                                            to talk to taskcluster queue.
          clientId                          Taskcluster client ID used by generic worker to
                                            talk to taskcluster queue.
          ed25519SigningKeyLocation         The ed25519 signing key for signing artifacts with.
          rootURL                           The root URL of the taskcluster deployment to which
                                            clientId and accessToken grant access. For example,
                                            'https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/'.
          workerId                          A name to uniquely identify your worker.
          workerType                        This should match a worker_type managed by the
                                            provisioner you have specified.

        ** OPTIONAL ** properties
        =========================

          availabilityZone                  The EC2 availability zone of the worker.
          cachesDir                         The directory where task caches should be stored on
                                            the worker. The directory will be created if it does
                                            not exist. This may be a relative path to the
                                            current directory, or an absolute path.
                                            [default: "caches"]
          certificate                       Taskcluster certificate, when using temporary
                                            credentials only.
          checkForNewDeploymentEverySecs    The number of seconds between consecutive calls
                                            to the provisioner, to check if there has been a
                                            new deployment of the current worker type. If a
                                            new deployment is discovered, worker will shut
                                            down. See deploymentId property. [default: 1800]
          cleanUpTaskDirs                   Whether to delete the home directories of the task
                                            users after the task completes. Normally you would
                                            want to do this to avoid filling up disk space,
                                            but for one-off troubleshooting, it can be useful
                                            to (temporarily) leave home directories in place.
                                            Accepted values: true or false. [default: true]
          deploymentId                      If running with --configure-for-aws, then between
                                            tasks, at a chosen maximum frequency (see
                                            checkForNewDeploymentEverySecs property), the
                                            worker will query the provisioner to get the
                                            updated worker type definition. If the deploymentId
                                            in the config of the worker type definition is
                                            different to the worker's current deploymentId, the
                                            worker will shut itself down. See
                                            https://bugzil.la/1298010
          disableReboots                    If true, no system reboot will be initiated by
                                            generic-worker program, but it will still return
                                            with exit code 67 if the system needs rebooting.
                                            This allows custom logic to be executed before

                                            (such as formatting a hard drive) and then
                                            rebooting in the run-generic-worker.bat script.

          tasksDir                          The location where task directories should be
                                            created on the worker.

          workerGroup                       Typically this would be an aws region - an
                                            identifier to uniquely identify which pool of
                                            workers this worker logically belongs to.

          workerLocation                    If a non-empty string, task commands will have environment variable
                                            TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION set to the value provided.

                                            Otherwise TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION environment
                                            variable will not be implicitly set in task commands.

          workerTypeMetaData                This arbitrary json blob will be included at the
                                            top of each task log. Providing information here,
                                            such as a URL to the code/config used to set up the
                                            worker type will mean that people running tasks on
                                            the worker type will have more information about how
                                            it was set up (for example what has been installed on
                                            the machine).
          wstAudience                       The audience value for which to request websocktunnel
                                            credentials, identifying a set of WST servers this
                                            worker could connect to.  Optional if not using websocktunnel
                                            to expose live logs.
          wstServerURL                      The URL of the websocktunnel server with which to expose
                                            live logs.  Optional if not using websocktunnel to expose
                                            live logs.

    If an optional config setting is not provided in the json configuration file, the
    default will be taken (defaults documented above).

    If no value can be determined for a required config setting, the generic-worker will
    exit with a failure message.

  Exit Codes:

    0      Tasks completed successfully; no more tasks to run (see config setting
           numberOfTasksToRun).
    64     Not able to load generic-worker config. This could be a problem reading the
           generic-worker config file on the filesystem, a problem talking to AWS/GCP
           metadata service, or a problem retrieving config/files from the taskcluster
           secrets service.` + exitCode65() + `
    67     A task user has been created, and the generic-worker needs to reboot in order
           to log on as the new task user. Note, the reboot happens automatically unless
           config setting disableReboots is set to true - in either code this exit code will
           be issued.
    68     The generic-worker hit its idle timeout limit (see config settings idleTimeoutSecs
           and shutdownMachineOnIdle).
    69     Worker panic - either a worker bug, or the environment is not suitable for running
           a task, e.g. a file cannot be written to the file system, or something else did
           not work that was required in order to execute a task. See config setting
           shutdownMachineOnInternalError.
    70     A new deploymentId has been issued in the AWS worker type configuration, meaning
           this worker environment is no longer up-to-date. Typcially workers should
           terminate.
    71     The worker was terminated via an interrupt signal (e.g. Ctrl-C pressed).
    72     The worker is running on spot infrastructure in AWS EC2 and has been served a
           spot termination notice, and therefore has shut down.
    73     The config provided to the worker is invalid.` + exitCode74() + `
