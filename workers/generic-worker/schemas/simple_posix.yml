      Env vars must be string to __string__ mappings (not number or boolean). For example:

      }

      Note, the following environment variables will automatically be set in the task
      commands:
        * `TASK_ID` - the task ID of the currently running task
        * `RUN_ID` - the run ID of the currently running task
        * `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` - the root URL of the taskcluster deployment
        * `TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL` (if taskcluster proxy feature enabled) - the
           taskcluster authentication proxy for making unauthenticated taskcluster
           API calls
        * `TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION`. See

        path:

          description: |-
            Relative path of the file/directory from the task directory. Note this is not an absolute
            path as is typically used in docker-worker, since the absolute task directory name is not
            known when the task is submitted. Example: `dist\regedit.exe`. It doesn't matter if
            forward slashes or backslashes are used.

            Name of the artifact, as it will be published. If not set, `path` will be used.
            Conventionally (although not enforced) path elements are forward slash separated. Example:
            `public/build/a/house`. Note, no scopes are required to read artifacts beginning `public/`.
            Artifact names not beginning `public/` are scope-protected (caller requires scopes to
            download the artifact). See the Queue documentation for more information.

            Date when artifact should expire must be in the future, no earlier than task deadline, but
            no later than task expiry. If not set, defaults to task expiry.

            Explicitly set the value of the HTTP `Content-Type` response header when the artifact(s)
            is/are served over HTTP(S). If not provided (this property is optional) the worker will
            guess the content type of artifacts based on the filename extension of the file storing
            the artifact content. It does this by looking at the system filename-to-mimetype mappings
            defined in multiple `mime.types` files located under `/etc`. Note, setting `contentType`
            on a directory artifact will apply the same contentType to all files contained in the
            directory.

          - gzip
          description: |-
            Content-Encoding for the artifact. If not provided, `gzip` will be used, except for the
            following file extensions, where `identity` will be used, since they are already
            compressed:

            * 7z

            encoding to all the files contained in the directory.

          The taskcluster proxy provides an easy and safe way to make authenticated
          taskcluster requests within the scope(s) of a particular task. See

      interactive:
        type: boolean
        title: Interactive shell
        description: |-
          This allows you to interactively run commands from within the worker
          as the task user. This may be useful for debugging purposes.
          Can be used for SSH-like access to the running worker.
          Note that this feature works differently from the `interactive` feature
          in docker worker, which `docker exec`s into the running container.
          Since tasks on generic worker are not guaranteed to be running in a
          container, a bash shell is started on the task user's account.
          A user can then `docker exec` into the a running container, if there
          is one.

      loopbackVideo:
        type: boolean
        title: Loopback Video device
        description: |-
          Video loopback device created using v4l2loopback.
          A video device will be available for the task. Its
          location will be passed to the task via environment
          variable `TASKCLUSTER_VIDEO_DEVICE`. The
          location will be `/dev/video<N>` where `<N>` is
          an integer between 0 and 255. The value of `<N>`
          is not static, and therefore either the environment
          variable should be used, or `/dev` should be
          scanned in order to determine the correct location.
          Tasks should not assume a constant value.

          This feature is only available on Linux. If a task
          is submitted with this feature enabled on a non-Linux,
          posix platform (FreeBSD, macOS), the task will resolve as
          `exception/malformed-payload`.
