    title: Env vars
    description: |-
      Env vars must be string to __string__ mappings (not number or boolean). For example:

        "BAR_TOTAL": "3"
      }
      ```

      Note, the following environment variables will automatically be set in the task
      commands:
        * `TASK_ID` - the task ID of the currently running task
        * `RUN_ID` - the run ID of the currently running task
        * `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` - the root URL of the taskcluster deployment
        * `TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL` (if taskcluster proxy feature enabled) - the
           taskcluster authentication proxy for making unauthenticated taskcluster
           API calls
        * `TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION`. See
          [RFC #0148](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0148-taskcluster-worker-location.md)

        path:
          title: Artifact location
          type: string
          description: |-
            Relative path of the file/directory from the task directory. Note this is not an absolute
            path as is typically used in docker-worker, since the absolute task directory name is not
            known when the task is submitted. Example: `dist\regedit.exe`. It doesn't matter if
            forward slashes or backslashes are used.

        name:

          type: string
          description: |-
            Name of the artifact, as it will be published. If not set, `path` will be used.
            Conventionally (although not enforced) path elements are forward slash separated. Example:
            `public/build/a/house`. Note, no scopes are required to read artifacts beginning `public/`.
            Artifact names not beginning `public/` are scope-protected (caller requires scopes to
            download the artifact). See the Queue documentation for more information.

            Date when artifact should expire must be in the future, no earlier than task deadline, but
            no later than task expiry. If not set, defaults to task expiry.

        contentType:

            Explicitly set the value of the HTTP `Content-Type` response header when the artifact(s)
            is/are served over HTTP(S). If not provided (this property is optional) the worker will
            guess the content type of artifacts based on the filename extension of the file storing
            the artifact content. It does this by looking at the system filename-to-mimetype mappings
            defined in multiple `mime.types` files located under `/etc`. Note, setting `contentType`
            on a directory artifact will apply the same contentType to all files contained in the
            directory.

            - gzip
          description: |-
            Content-Encoding for the artifact. If not provided, `gzip` will be used, except for the
            following file extensions, where `identity` will be used, since they are already
            compressed:

            * 7z

            Note, setting `contentEncoding` on a directory artifact will apply the same content
            encoding to all the files contained in the directory.
