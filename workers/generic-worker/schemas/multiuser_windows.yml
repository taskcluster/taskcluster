      Env vars must be string to __string__ mappings (not number or boolean). For example:

        "FOO_ENABLE": "true",
        "BAR_TOTAL": "3"
      }
      ```

      Note, the following environment variables will automatically be set in the task
      commands:
        * `TASK_ID` - the task ID of the currently running task
        * `RUN_ID` - the run ID of the currently running task
        * `TASK_WORKDIR` - the working directory of the currently running task
        * `TASK_GROUP_ID` - the task group ID of the currently running task
        * `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` - the root URL of the taskcluster deployment
        * `TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL` (if taskcluster proxy feature enabled) - the
           taskcluster authentication proxy for making unauthenticated taskcluster
           API calls
        * `TASK_USER_CREDENTIALS` (if payload feature `runTaskAsCurrentUser` set to
          `true` in the task definition - the absolute file location of a
          json file containing the current task OS user account name and password.
          This is only useful for the generic-worker multiuser CI tasks, where
          `runTaskAsCurrentUser` is set to `true`.
        * `TASKCLUSTER_INSTANCE_TYPE` - the cloud instance type of the worker (optional, not all workers run in a cloud)
        * `TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION`. See
          [RFC #0148](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0148-taskcluster-worker-location.md)

            Relative path of the file/directory from the task directory. Note this is not an absolute
            path as is typically used in docker-worker, since the absolute task directory name is not
            known when the task is submitted. Example: `dist\regedit.exe`. It doesn't matter if

            Name of the artifact, as it will be published. If not set, `path` will be used.
            Conventionally (although not enforced) path elements are forward slash separated. Example:
            `public/build/a/house`. Note, no scopes are required to read artifacts beginning `public/`.
            Artifact names not beginning `public/` are scope-protected (caller requires scopes to
            download the artifact). See the Queue documentation for more information.

            Explicitly set the value of the HTTP `Content-Type` response header when the artifact(s)
            is/are served over HTTP(S). If not provided (this property is optional) the worker will
            guess the content type of artifacts based on the filename extension of the file storing
            the artifact content. It does this by looking at the system filename-to-mimetype mappings
            defined in the Windows registry. Note, setting `contentType` on a directory artifact will
            apply the same contentType to all files contained in the directory.

        description: |-
          The taskcluster proxy provides an easy and safe way to make authenticated
          taskcluster requests within the scope(s) of a particular task. See
          [the github project](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/tools/taskcluster-proxy) for more information.

      runAsAdministrator:
        type: boolean
        title: Run commands with UAC process elevation
        description: |-
          Runs commands with UAC elevation. Only set to true when UAC is
          enabled on the worker and Administrative privileges are required by
          task commands. When UAC is disabled on the worker, task commands will
          already run with full user privileges, and therefore a value of true
          will result in a malformed-payload task exception.

          A value of true does not add the task user to the `Administrators`
          group - see the `osGroups` property for that. Typically
          `task.payload.osGroups` should include an Administrative group, such
          as `Administrators`, when setting to true.

          For security, `runAsAdministrator` feature cannot be used in
          conjunction with `chainOfTrust` feature.

          Requires scope

      runTaskAsCurrentUser:
        type: boolean
        title: Run task as current user
        description: |-
          If `true`, task commands will be executed as the
          user currently running Generic Worker (typically
          `root` or `LocalSystem`), rather than as the
          dedicated task user created for the task. The task
          user account will still be created, and is
          available for the task to use.

          Requires scope `generic-worker:run-task-as-current-user:<provisionerID>/<workerType>`.
          Tasks submitted without this scope will be resolved
          as `exception/malformed-payload`.

      resourceMonitor:

          Average System Memory Used, Average Available System Memory,
          and Total System Memory in the task log for each task command
          executed. It also will abort any task command if the used
          system memory exceeds worker config maxMemoryUsagePercent
          _AND_ available system memory drops below worker config
          minAvailableMemoryBytes for longer than worker config
          allowedHighMemoryDuration seconds. When this happens, the
          task will be resolved as failed.

          This allows you to interactively run commands from within the worker
          as the task user. This may be useful for debugging purposes.
          Can be used for SSH-like access to the running worker.
          Note that this feature works differently from the `interactive` feature
          in docker worker, which `docker exec`s into the running container.
          Since tasks on generic worker are not guaranteed to be running in a
          container, a powershell instance is started on the task user's account.
          A user can then `docker exec` into the a running container, if there
          is one.

          If `true`, the command window for each command will be hidden.
          This is useful for tasks that run GUI applications to prevent
          the command window from obscuring the application window.

          If your task needs to allocate new consoles (with
          AllocConsole(), for example) then you should not use this.

  rdpInfo:

    title: RDP Info
    description: |-
      Specifies an artifact name for publishing RDP connection information.

      Since this is potentially sensitive data, care should be taken to publish
      to a suitably locked down path, such as
      `login-identity/<login-identity>/rdpinfo.json` which is only readable for
      the given login identity (for example
      `login-identity/mozilla-ldap/pmoore@mozilla.com/rdpinfo.json`). See the
      [artifact namespace guide](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/using/namespaces#artifacts) for more information.

      Use of this feature requires scope
      `generic-worker:allow-rdp:<provisionerId>/<workerType>` which must be
      declared as a task scope.

      The RDP connection data is published during task startup so that a user
      may interact with the running task.

      The task environment will be retained for 12 hours after the task
      completes, to enable an interactive user to perform investigative tasks.
      After these 12 hours, the worker will delete the task's Windows user
      account, and then continue with other tasks.

      No guarantees are given about the resolution status of the interactive
      task, since the task is inherently non-reproducible and no automation
      should rely on this value.
