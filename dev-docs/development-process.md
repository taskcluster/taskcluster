# Development Process

Welcome to Taskcluster development!

Taskcluster is composed of a bunch of microservices, some libraries, the React user interface, some client libraries, and a bunch of infrastructure to glue it all together.
You will probably be working on only one of these pieces, so read carefully below to see what you need to do.

## Setup

To set up the repository, run `yarn` in the root directory.
This will install all required dependencies from the Yarn registry.

For some of the commands below, such as `mocha`, you will need to make sure that `node_modules/.bin` is in your PATH.
To set this up, in the root directory, run

```sh
export PATH=$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
```

All of the server-side code runs in Node, and uses the [debug](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/debug) module to log debugging information.
You can see all debugging output with

```sh
export DEBUG=*
```

and can filter out specific debugging output with other values, as described in the [module documentation](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/blob/master/README.md).

## Hacking on the UI

The files comprising the Taskcluster UI are under [`ui/`](../ui).
It relies on a microservice called web-server, which you will need to run in a different terminal window.
To run the Taskcluster UI:

* In a shell window for taskcluster-web-server:
  * Set `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` to point to a Taskcluster deployment you wish to represent in the UI.
    For example:

    ```sh
    export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=https://taskcluster-staging.net
    ```
  * Change to the `services/web-server` directory and run `yarn start`.
    This will start a web server on port 3050.
    Note that it will warn "No Pulse namespace defined".
    Unless you are working on parts of the UI that require Pulse support (and most do not), this is OK.

* In another shell window for taskcluster-ui:
  * Change to the `ui/` directory.
  * Run `yarn` to install the user interface's dependencies.
    You will only need to do this when the dependencies change.
  * Run `yarn start` to start the development server.
    It will output a localhost URL on which you can see the site.

## Hacking on Services and Libraries

To run all of the tests for a service, change into the directory containing the service (for example, `cd services/queue`) and run `yarn test`.
Unless you provide additional credentials, lots of tests will be skipped.
Many of these are *duplicate* runs of tests, labeled "real" and "mock".

For most changes, the mock tests are sufficient to detect errors.
To be sure, follow the TDD practice of writing your tests first, ensuring that they fail before you fix the bug or add the feature.
If your new test is skipped, then consult with one of the Taskcluster team members to see how you can get some credentials.

To run a specific test file, you can use `mocha` directly:

```sh
# run just the `api_test` file
mocha test/api_test.js
# run the tests in that file until the first failure
mocha -b test/api_test.js
```

### Generating Code

If you change the API for a service (even changing documentation), you will need to regenerate the API references.
Happily, this is easy.
In the root directory of the repository, run `yarn generate`.
It will change a few files, and you should include those changes in your Git commit.

### Running Services

We generally depend on tests to ensure that services are behaving correctly.
It is rare to run a service directly.
However, it's possible!

Look in `procs.yml` in the service's directory to see what processes you can run.
For example, you might see:

```yaml
expireArtifacts:
  type: cron
  schedule: '0 0 * * *'
  deadline: 86400
  command: node src/main expire-artifacts
```

To run this process locally:
```sh
NODE_ENV=development node src/main expire-artifacts
```

You may need to provide additional configuration, either as environment variables or in `user-config.yml`.
You can find a template for `user-config.yml` in `user-config-example.yml`: just copy the latter to the former and edit it.

## Hacking on Clients

The clients are in `clients/`.
One, `client-web`, is designed for use in web browsers, while the other, `client`, is intended for use in Node environments.
In fact, it is used by all of the services and libraries in the repository.
Note that taskcluster-ui does not use `client-web`, since it communicates with web-server via GraphQL.

Both clients contain a great deal of generated code.
Use `yarn generate`, as described above, to ensure that any changes you make are not overwritten by the code-generation system.

## Building the Taskcluster Docker Image

A Taskcluster deployment is based on a Docker image that contains all Taskcluster services, including the UI.
It's rare to use this image during development, as running the image requires lots of credentials and a special environment.

But you're welcome to build the image!
It's easy: `yarn build` in the root directory.
