# Development Deployments

_NOTE:_ You probably do not need a dev deployment!
Dev deployments are useful for manually testing high-level functionality in a realistic situation.
As a rule, Taskcluster's built-in automated tests are sufficient, and should be kept up-to-date with any changes.
Manual testing of changes is not sufficient, and not required to merge a change.
Moreover, dev deployments are difficult and consume substantial resources.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following

* A running kubernetes cluster with at least 2000 mCPU and 4GB RAM available.
  * Helm 3 installed
  * The latest version of kubectl installed, and credentials configured to talk to the cluster
* A RabbitMQ cluster running the latest available version. (see also [install RabbitMQ](#own-rabbitmq-in-cluster))
  The deployment process requires administrative access (the RabbitMQ management API) and creates multiple users.
  The free levels of CloudAMQP's service do not support this.
* A Postgres server running Postgres 11.x (see below for Google Cloud SQL, or use another provider). (see also [install Postgres](#own-postgres-in-cluster))
  The Postgres server must be initialized with the `en_US.utf8` locale; see [the deployment docs](../ui/docs/manual/deploying/database.mdx).
* An AWS account and an IAM user in that account
  Set up your `aws` command-line to use the IAM user (`aws configure`).
  The user must be able to configure S3 and IAM resources.
  It's safe to use a root or admin account for this, as it is just used to create new IAM users which will be used by the Taskcluster deployment.
* A hostname for which you control DNS.
  Your deployments "root URL" will be `https://<hostname>`.

You can also use [cert-manager](#cert-manager) to automatically provision certificates and use [ingress nginx](#ingress-nginx) for a non-GKE deployment (or deployment without using GLB).

You should also familiarize yourself with [the deployment docs](../ui/docs/manual/deploying/database.mdx).

### Google Kubernetes

For GKE, set up a Kubernetes cluster and then run `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` locally to set up `kubectl`.

Set up an IP for your deployment:

1. Set up an IP address: `gcloud compute addresses create <yourname>-ingress-ip --global`.
   You can find the assigned IP in `gcloud compute addresses list`, and put it into DNS as an A record.
1. Create a certificate: `certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns`.  This will ask you to add a TXT record to the DNS.
   Note that certbot is installed with `brew install letsencrypt` on macOS.
1. Upload the certificate: `gcloud compute ssl-certificates create <yourname>-ingress --certificate <path-to-fullchain.pem> --private-key <path-to-key>`. When the time comes to renew the certificate, simply increment the name (e.g., <yourname>-ingress-1).

### Ingress nginx

If you want more flexibility you can use [ingress nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) to handle all incoming requests instead of default Load Balancer.

1. Reserve a static IP address. (by using your cloud provider tools)
1. Create DNS entry that will point to a static IP address from previous step. (AWS Route53 or GCP CloudDNS)
1. Install ingress nginx by running following or checking deployment-specific [documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/)

   ```sh
   helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
   helm repo update
   helm install ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
      --name nginx-ingress \
      --namespace ingress-nginx \
      --set controller.service.loadBalancerIP="$STATIC_IP_ADDRESS"
   ```

1. In `dev-config.yml` specify `ingressType: nginx` to make sure ingress routes are valid
1. Refer to [cert-manager](#cert-manager) documentation on how to setup automatic provisioning of certificates.

### Minikube

If you want to run taskcluster on a kubernetes cluster on a server or virtual machine, minikube can be used.
Follow the regular installation for minikube, however:

1. Make sure to deploy a kubernetes cluster with at least 2 CPUs and 4GB of memory.
2. Enable the nginx ingress on the minikube cluster.

#### SSL through a reverse proxy

In order to not have to fiddle with secrets for the nginx ingress, you can alternatively put apache2 or nginx on the host, and then having this act as a reverse proxy. Point it at port 80 (HTTP) of the ingress that is created once you deployed taskcluster.

Example configuration with SSL on the reverse proxy:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
   ServerName <subdomain>.<domain>.<tld> # example: taskcluster.example.com
   SSLEngine on
   SSLProxyEngine on
   SSLProtocol             all -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
   SSLCertificateFile      /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem # Or when not using letsencrypt, the path to your cert + CA chain.
   SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/privkey.pem # Or when not using letsencrypt, the path to your certificate's private key.

   # HTTP Strict Transport Security (mod_headers is required) (63072000 seconds)
   Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000"
   ProxyPass / https://x.x.x.x/ nocanon # Replace with the ingress IP of your taskcluster deployment. kubectl get ingress
   ProxyPassReverse / https://x.x.x.x/ # Replace with the ingress IP of your taskcluster deployment. kubectl get ingress
   ProxyPreserveHost on
   SSLProxyCheckPeerCN off # Required when not using a trusted SSL cert (when not changing the ingress SSL cert)
   AllowEncodedSlashes on
</VirtualHost>
```

### Deploying custom images to dev cluster

In order to build experimental build that is not based on official `taskcluster/taskcluster` docker images, you can start with building your image locally.
(Note: keep in mind what architecture is being used on the cluster)

```sh
# build and push custom image
docker builder build --tag username/taskcluster-dev:${VERSION} --platform linux/amd64 .
docker push username/taskcluster-dev:${VERSION}

# Update value in dev-config.yml
# dockerImage: username/taskcluster-dev:${VERSION}

# run deployment
yarn dev:apply
```

### Deploying custom images from private registry

Kubernetes supports [pulling images from private registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/).

You will have to set those two variables in your `dev-config.yml`:

```yml
dockerImage: path.to/private/registry:tag
imagePullSecret: dockerSecretsName
```

Where `dockerSecretsName` is a secret name that holds docker authentication for that private registry. See [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials)

```sh
# using credentials:
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerSecretsName --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pword> --docker-email=<your-email>
# or using .dockerconfigjson
kubectl create secret generic dockerSecretsName \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

#### Troubleshooting:
* Certbot error `[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/log/letsencrypt' Either run as root, or set --config-dir, --work-dir, and --logs-dir to writeable paths.` - do not run as root, but set the directories instead.

__NOTE:__ be sure to point the reverse proxy at the ingress IP using HTTPS and preserving the host, ignore SSL validation if needed (of the ingress)

#### SSL certificate from LetsEncrypt

LetsEncrypt  provides free SSL certificates for publically accessable websites. [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is a popular option to request, and depending on the webserver automatically deploy and renew SSL certificates.

#### Secure SSL configuration for apache/gninx

For a secure SSL configuration for your webserver, [Mozilla's SSL Configuration](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/) tool provides with multiple secure configurations for multiple webservers.

### Google Cloud SQL

To set up a Google Cloud SQL server:

 1. In the Google Cloud Console, create a new SQL instance.  Its name doesn't really matter.  Generate but ignore the password for the postgres user.  It will take a while to create.
 1. Under "Connections", enable "Public IP" and allow access from your development system or wherever you'll be running DB upgrades from.  You can use 0.0.0.0/0 here, if you'd like -- Google will complain, but it's development data.
 1. Still under "Connections", enable "Private IP".
    See https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip.
    If this is the first time setting this up in a project, then you'll need to enable the Service Networking API and your account must have the "Network Administrator" role so that Cloud SQL can do some complicated networking stuff behind the scenes.
    Note that there are two buttons to click: "Allocate and Create" and then later "Save".
    Each can take several minutes.

That much only needs to be done once, in fact -- multiple dev environments can share the same DB.  For a specific deployment:

  1. Under "Users", create a new user with the name of your deployment (`<yourname>`) and generate a good password and make a note of it.
       * This will also be the "username prefix" from which the per-service usernames are derived
       * Google creates this user as a superuser on the server, which is a bit more than required, but will do for development environments.
  1. Under "Databases", create one with the name of your deployment (`<yourname>`).

You will need the following to tell `yarn dev:init`:

 * Public and Private IP addresses (on the "Overview" tab)
 * The admin username and password
 * The database name

### taskcluster-dev.net hostnames

For those working on the project full-time, we can create a subdomain of `taskcluster-dev.net`.
This is controlled by the Route53 zone in the `taskcluster-aws-staging` AWS account.
Someone with access to that account will need to create the A record, and add any other records required to validate the domain for LetsEncrypt.

## Verify

This section uses `yarn dev:init` to automatically set up the various things Taskcluster requires.
This includes users on the RabbitMQ and Postgres cluster, AWS resources, and so on.
It creates and updates a file named `dev-config.yml` in the root of the repository.

To run `yarn dev:..` commands, you'll need to install the node dependencies, as described in [development-process](development-process.md).

1. `yarn dev:init` will ask you a bunch of questions and fill out your local config for you (most of it anyway).
   Once it has done this, your `dev-config.yml` is filled with secrets so don't leak it.
   These are dev-only secrets though so don't be too worried.
   Once this command has completed successfully, you can edit `dev-config.yml` to suit yourself.
1. Run `yarn dev:verify` and see if it complains about any missing values in your configuration.
   If any are missing or incorrect, fix them in `dev-config.yml` and try again.
   Please file issues for any fields that `yarn dev:init` missed or got wrong.

### Troubleshooting

* Dev config creation step: `AccessDenied: Access Denied` error with a stack trace pointing at aws-sdk library - make sure to have your aws credentials are fetched and stored in environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.
* Helm error `Error: stat taskcluster: no such file or directory` - make sure you have helm3 installed.
* Kubectl error: `Error: unknown flag --current` - make sure you run kubectl v1.15.0 or later

## Apply

Until now, nothing has been deployed into the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Run `yarn dev:db:upgrade` to upgrade the DB to the current version of the database.
   You will generally want to do this before deploying with `dev:apply`, if any DB changes need to be applied.
   This command is a thin wrapper around `yarn db:upgrade` that sets the necessary environment variables, so feel free to use that command instead if you prefer.
1. `yarn dev:apply` will use helm+kubectl to apply all of your kubernetes resources to the cluster.
   *Note that this will create a new namespace in the cluster for you and switch your kubectl context to it*.
   If you make changes to `dev-config.yml`, just apply again. It should change anything you've changed and remove anything you've removed.

If you need it, `yarn dev:delete` will uninstall your deployment.

## Test It Out!

Your deployment is up and running.
Have a look at the root URL -- it should load the Taskcluster UI.
Other URLs such as `/references/` or `/api/queue/v1/ping` should also do interesting things.

Have a look at the set of running deployments (`kubectl get deployments`) to see what is running, or what has failed.
Note that the `taskcluster-github` service will not work yet -- see below to set that up, or configure it to not run (set `github.procs.web.replicas` to 0, and the same for its other deployments).

### Deploying a Local Build

If you want to deploy local changes, run `yarn build --push` and add the resulting image id to your config file with the key `dockerImage`.
If you don't have permission to push to the Docker repository, you can push the image elsewhere manually.

## Setting up a Taskcluster Github app in your Development Cluster

You will need:
1. Development cluster up and running (see above)
2. A github app created and installed for a testing repository.

To set up a taskcluster-github app:
0. In the settings of the github app that you created, at the very bottom of the General tab, you will find Generate Private Key button.
Press it to generate the private key.
1. In your `dev-config.yml`, in the `github` section, add `github_private_pem` - you can copy-paste the contents of the
PEM file you have obtained in the previous step. Be careful to remove any newlines from the encrypted part,
and the necessary newlines after the header and before the footer should be replaced with `\n`, so the whole thing is a one-line string
like this: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEpAIBAAKCAQEblahblahblah==\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
2. Populate the `github_app_id` in the `dev-config.yml` (it's the numerical `App ID` you will find in the app settings, near the top of the General tab)
3. Set `webhook_secret` in your `dev-config.yml` to whatever it is set to in the app if you have it enabled.
4. In the app settings, on that same General tab, find the Webhook URL field. Enter the api URL in there (should be something like
`https://<YOUR_ROOT_URL>/api/github/v1/github`).
5. Leave the Webhook Secret field empty, make sure the app is Active and the SSL verification is enabled. On the Permissions & Events tab,
_carefully_ add permissions. Do not give it more permissions than it needs.
6. Try it on a test repo. If the app doesn't work, go into the app settings, Advanced tab, and look at the webhook deliveries.
Logs of tc-github service are also good for a few laughs.
7. If the app does work but lacks scopes, you can add those by creating a `repo:github.com/<TEST_OWNER>/<TEST_REPO>:*` role
and adding the scopes to that role.
8. If you need functional workers to go with the app, make sure to set up a provider in the cloud you need and then create a workerpool
for that provider.

## Publishing Pulse Messages in Your Development Cluster

If you set up a taskcluster-github app, you probably want to test a variety of its functionality. So you might need to impersonate a worker (of course, you can also set up an actual worker, but if workers are not what you are trying to test, that might be an overkill). There might be other uses for this as well, as Taskcluster services communicate with each other via pulse messages, so any integration testing would need this.
1. In your `dev-config.yml`, look up `pulseHostname` and `meta.rabbitAdminUser`. In the passwordstore, get the password for that user.
2. Put together a body of your pulse message. Make sure you use the schemas. It should be in JSON format.
3. Look up the routing key and exchange you need (most likely you are testing a handler - so look up the bindings for that handler in the code).
3. Navigate to the management UI on the RabbitMQ server (the url from `pulseHostname`), login using the above credentials and go to the exchange of interest. You will see *Publish Message* section in the UI. Fill out the *Routing Key* and *Payload* fields (the result of the step 2 goes into the latter). Press *Publish Message* and you're done.

## Own RabbitMQ in cluster

It is possible to run RabbitMQ directly in the same cluster for dev purposes.

Warning: by using this approach, you are responsible for maintenance and backups.

You can use one of the existing helm charts, steps listed below:

1. Add helm repository:

   `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
2. To enable TLS you need to create certificates according to [RabbitMQ Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html#automated-certificate-generation)
   <details>
   <summary>
   Generate and upload rabbitmq-certificates
   </summary>

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/michaelklishin/tls-gen tls-gen

   cd tls-gen/basic
   make && make verify && make info

   cd result
   cp ca_certificate.pem ca.crt && cp server_certificate.pem tls.crt && cp server_key.pem tls.key

   kubectl -n $NAMESPACE create secret generic rabbitmq-certificates \
      --from-file=./ca.crt \
      --from-file=./tls.crt \
      --from-file=./tls.key
   ```
   </details>
3. Create config with chart values:
   <details>
   <summary><code>rabbitmq/values.yaml</code></summary>

   ```yaml
   auth:
      username: admin
      password: adminpassword      # set some strong management password
      erlangCookie: secretcookie   # set some cookie secret

   tls:
      enabled: true
      existingSecret: rabbitmq-certificates  # same name of the secret from the previous step
   ```

   More details at <https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/rabbitmq>
   </details>
4. Install chart:

   `helm install tc-rabbitmq --namespace $NAMESPACE -f ./rabbitmq/values.yaml bitnami/rabbitmq`

   This will create several resources. By default it will create Persisted Volume Claim for `8Gb` of disk that will be persisted by kubernetes cluster.
5. Create proxy (port forwarding) to be able to access management panel:

   `kubectl port-forward --namespace $NAMESPACE svc/tc-rabbitmq 15672:15672`

   You are now able to access it via <http://localhost:15672> using username and password configured in `rabbitmq/values.yaml`.

6. Ensure that vhost and users are created.

   In your `dev-config.yml` (that is created with `yarn dev:init`) you should have `meta.rabbitAdminManagementOrigin = http://127.0.0.1:15672` to be able to properly access it

   Run `yarn dev:ensure:rabbit` to create missing users and vhost. It will prompt for management password (see `rabbitmq/values.yaml`), and assumes that `dev-config.yml` was already generated.

7. Update `dev-config.yml` to have:

   `pulseHostname = tc-rabbitmq-headless` if running in the same namespace, or `pulseHostname: tc-rabbitmq-headless.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local` otherwise

   In case of connection issues, set non tls mode with `pulseAmqps = false`

8. Run `yarn dev:apply` if needed, to recreate configs and secrets with new pulse values.

## Own Postgres in cluster

It is possible to run Postgres directly in the same cluster for dev purposes.

Warning: by using this approach, you are responsible for maintenance and backups.

1. Add helm repository:

   `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`

2. Create config with chart values:
   <details>
   <summary><code>postgres/values.yaml</code></summary>

   ```yaml
   auth:
      postgresPassword: rootpassword  # set something strong
      username: taskcluster
      password: taskcluster  # set something strong
      database: taskcluster

   tls:
      enabled: true
      autoGenerated: true

   volumePermissions:
      enabled: true

   image:
      tag: 11  # Taskcluster currently supports version 11
   ```

   More details at <https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/postgresql>
   </details>
3. Install chart:

   `helm install tc-postgresql --namespace $NAMESPACE -f ./postgresql/values.yaml bitnami/postgresql`

   This will create several resources. By default it will create Persisted Volume Claim for `8Gb` of disk that will be persisted by kubernetes cluster.
4. Create proxy (port forwarding) to be able to access Postgres locally:

   `kubectl port-forward --namespace $NAMESPACE svc/tc-postgresql 5432:5432`

   You are now able to connect to it via <http://localhost:5432> using username and password configured in `postgres/values.yaml`.

5. Ensure that users are created.

   In your `dev-config.yml` (that is created with `yarn dev:init`) you should have `meta.dbPrivateIp = tc-postgresql.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local` to be able to properly access it

   `yarn dev:ensure:db` will create all necessary users for all services

6. Migrate database

   Once users are set, you can run `yarn dev:db:upgrade` (with running port-forward) to create db schema and stored functions

Now it should be possible to use postgres for dev purposes inside the cluster. Make sure to make backups.

## GCP Cloud Build

Commits that land on `main` trigger a build on GCP Cloud Build. This build is configured by the [`cloudbuild.yaml` file](../cloudbuild.yaml). Here's a link to Google's docs on the build config file schema for cloud build: https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-config-file-schema.

A couple secrets are used in the config and they are both stored in GCP Secret Manager. Follow [these docs](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/use-secrets) to create more secrets or edit the current secrets. A new version needs to be created each time you change the secrets. The current cloudbuild config points to the latest version of the secrets, so any edits to these secrets will be automatically picked up.

## Cert Manager

You have a choice to use [cert manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) that can automatically issue certificates for your domains.

You can use [helm](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/#example-usage) to install it:

```sh
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm install \
  --name cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --version v1.9.1 \  # check latest version for cert-manager.io
  jetstack/cert-manager \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

You will also need to create `ClusterIssuer` resources that will tell cert-manager how to obtain those certificates.

`kubectl apply -f ./certbot-issuers.yaml`

 <details>
   <summary><code>certbot-issuers.yml</code></summary>

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: ClusterIssuer
   metadata:
   name: letsencrypt-staging
   spec:
      acme:
         server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
         email: your@email.dev
         privateKeySecretRef:
            name: letsencrypt-staging
         solvers:
         - http01:
            ingress:
               class: nginx

   ---

   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: ClusterIssuer
   metadata:
   name: letsencrypt-prod
   spec:
      acme:
         server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
         email: your@email.dev
         privateKeySecretRef:
            name: letsencrypt-prod
         solvers:
         - http01:
            ingress:
               class: nginx
   ```

   This sample configuration assumes you have also installed [ingress nginx](#ingress-nginx) that will be used to accept incoming HTTP verification requests automatically.

   In this case please also make sure that your DNS configuration has correct records that point to the ingress-nginx.
</details>

For all possible configuration possibilities please refer to the [issuer documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/).

In the `dev-config.yml` you will need to set those values:

```yml
certManagerClusterIssuerName: letsencrypt-prod # that's the name of the install cluster issuer to use
ingressTlsSecretName: my-tls-cert # name of the secret, where cert manager will store obtained certificate
```

Certbot will automatically renew certificates and update `ingressTlsSecretName` secret.
