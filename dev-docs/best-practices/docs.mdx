# Documentation Best Practices

Taskcluster's documentation is expansive, and is divided roughly according to audience.
In many cases, documentation changes for a single pull request or feature should occur in multiple places.

## Web Docs

These are the docs available at `/docs` on any deployment, and centrally hosted at https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs.
This documentation is targeted at *users* of Taskcluster - people creating tasks, making API calls, using the UI, and so on.
There are several chapters in this documentation:

* Tutorial -- meant to be a gentle introduction to "what is this??"
* Manual -- narrative, user-focused descriptions of how things work
* Reference -- authoritative documentation on how systems work

The manual summarizes the information such users would need, including descriptions of conventions and suggestions for ways to use the service effectively.
Its audience is users with a problem to solve, such as "how do I make one task depend on another"?
The manual typically explains concepts broadly and then links to the reference chapter for details.

The reference chapter contains the authoritative, technical information a user needs to know to interact with various parts of Taskcluster.
Many parts of the reference documentation are automatically generated to ensure they are up to date.
The audience for this chapter is users at the implementation stage of their work and looking for precise, detailed information.

## Dev-Docs

Development docs are linked from the [README](../../README.mdx) at the top level of the Taskcluster Git repository.
They are intended for people developing Taskcluster.
Developers would typically look to this documentation to answer questions like "how does this implementation work?" or "what's the right way to make this change?"

Developer documentation can be found at:

* [`/clients/*/README.mdx`](../../clients) - authoritative documentation for usage of the JS client libraries.
  This documentation is also available for users from the appropriate packaging hosts, such as [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/taskcluster/).

* [`/libraries/*/README.mdx`](../../libraries) - authoritative documentation for usage of the JS libraries shared by all TC services.

* [`/services/*/README.mdx`](../../services) - documentation for working on individual services.
  This is typically limited to advice for running tests, but [sometimes](../../services/worker-manager/providers.mdx) includes instructions for writing specific kinds of modules.

* [`/dev-docs`](../) - higher-level developer documentation that crosses boundaries between services and libraries

* [`/dev-docs/best-practices`](./) - guidelines we've agreed on for Taskcluster development, in an effort to keep the codebase consistent and permit developers to move easily throughout the codebase.

## Deployment-Docs

Deployment docs are located in a section of the manual chapter.
They are intended for people deploying Taskcluster.
They cover topics such as:

* Running Taskcluster services
* Taskcluster service configuration
* Monitoring (logging, metrics, and error reporting)
* Debuggging advice
