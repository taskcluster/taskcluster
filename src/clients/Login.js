  // Given an OIDC `access_token` from a trusted OpenID provider, return a
  // set of Taskcluster credentials for use on behalf of the identified
  // user.
  // This method is typically not called with a Taskcluster client library
  // and does not accept Hawk credentials. The `access_token` should be
  // given in an `Authorization` header:
  // ```
  // Authorization: Bearer abc.xyz
  // ```
  // The `access_token` is first verified against the named
  // :provider, then passed to the provider's API to retrieve a user
  // profile. That profile is then used to generate Taskcluster credentials
  // appropriate to the user. Note that the resulting credentials may or may
  // not include a `certificate` property. Callers should be prepared for either
  // alternative.
  // The given credentials will expire in a relatively short time. Callers should
  // monitor this expiration and refresh the credentials if necessary, by calling
  // this endpoint again, if they have expired.
