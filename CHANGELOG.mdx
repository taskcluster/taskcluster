# Change Log

<!-- `yarn release` will insert the existing changelog snippets here: -->
<!-- NEXT RELEASE HERE -->

## v16.2.0

[minor] ([bug 1561320](http://bugzil.la/1561320)) Taskcluster deployments now support sentry error reporting. You can configure this option by setting
an `errorConfig` at the top-level of your config:

```
rootUrl: ...
errorConfig:
  reporter: SentryReporter
  dsn: <your sentry dsn>
```

Errors will be reported to this project and tagged with service/process names in addition to taskcluster
release version.

([bug 1574656](http://bugzil.la/1574656)) Worker-pool configurations for google-based providers now accept a `workerConfig` property, which is passed to new workers.
The existing `userData` property is deprecated.

## v16.1.0

[minor] ([bug 1572775](http://bugzil.la/1572775)) * All lib-loader `setup` functions now get passed their own
  name to allow logging more usefully.
* There is now a document in dev-docs explaining recommended
  monitoring practices.

[minor] ([bug 1553953](http://bugzil.la/1553953)) The `workerType` identifier now has a more restrictive pattern:
 * consisting of lower-case alphanumeric plus dash (`-`)
 * from 1 to 38 characters long
 * beginning with a lower-case alphabetic character
 * ending with a lower-case alphanumeric character (not a dash)
Any worker types not matching this pattern will no longer function as of this version.

This is considered a minor change because no known workerTypes (aside from some
internal testing workerTypes) violate this pattern.

[minor] ([bug 1572764](http://bugzil.la/1572764)) The go client doesn't log the full request in case of an error anymore.
It logs only the method, hostname, port and response body. It logs the
full request when the environment variable `TASKCLUSTER_DEBUG` is
defined.

[minor] ([#1190](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1190)) Updates a number of config variables including:

* Setting `pulse-namespace` per service is no longer supported
* Services that no longer use aws directly no longer take credentials
* Setting table names for secrets, notify, and hooks services is no longer supported

The name of the hooks last fires table has changed so you must update your static
client scopes in your deployment from including `auth:azure-table:read-write:${azureAccountId}/LastFire`
to `auth:azure-table:read-write:${azureAccountId}/LastFire3`.

## v16.0.0

[MAJOR] ([bug 1552970](http://bugzil.la/1552970)) The `auth.gcpCredentials` method no longer modifies the *granting* service account.
Instead, that service account must be configured with the "Service Account Token Creator" role prior to deployment of Taskcluster.
The format of configuration for these credentials has changed as well, now taking `GCP_CREDENTIALS_ALLOWED_PROJECTS`.
See the deployment documentation for more information.

[MAJOR] ([bug 1570723](http://bugzil.la/1570723)) The deployment configuration value `ui.ui_login_strategy_names` is now required.
It should be a space-separated list of the names of the strategies in `web_server.ui_login_strategies`.

[minor] ([#1140](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1140)) Add Chain of Trust documentation for taskcluster worker implementations and maintenance.

[minor] ([#1062](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1062)) The taskcluster cli `rerun` action now takes a `--force` option. It will refuse to rerun non-exception, non-failed tasks without `--force`.

([#1108](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1108)) The development process has been improved to use kubectl directly instead of helm.
Helm is still used to render templates because we need to support it.

## v15.0.0

[MAJOR] The web-server application no longer generates a JWT when logging in. It uses a sessions to keep track of users.
The `JWT_KEY` configuration variable in web-server should be replaced with `SESSION_SECRET` which is used to compute
the session hash.

[MAJOR] ([#1005](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1005)) There is now a checked-in helm chart in `infrastructure/k8s`. Using this anyone should
be able to deploy taskcluster by just setting up the configuration.

To facilitate this, some environment variables for configuring services have changed:

* All services now take `AZURE_ACCOUNT_ID` instead of `AZURE_ACCOUNT` or `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`
* Hooks takes `AZURE_CRYPTO_KEY` and `AZURE_SIGNING_KEY` instead of `TABLE_CRYPTO_KEY` and `TABLE_SIGNING_KEY`

[minor] ([#1084](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1084)) The Dockerfile for the Taskcluster services is now checked-in rather than
generated at build time. It has been reordered so that changes to things
other than package.json won't re-install packages.

## v14.3.1

Include generated APIs in python package.

## v14.3.0

[minor] Pulse messages now include a task's tags for better classification of the messages that are received.

[minor] ([bug 1563545](http://bugzil.la/1563545)) The `apiMethod` log structure has been updated so that it now splits out query params into their own field and only logs the useful part of paths for resources.

[minor] ([bug 1558345](http://bugzil.la/1558345)) The experimental `workerManager.credentialsGoogle` API method has been removed and replaced with a similar but more provider-agnostic `workerManager.registerWorker` method.

[minor] ([bug 1523807](http://bugzil.la/1523807)) The taskcluster command-line interface (taskcluster-cli) has been incorporated into the main repository and will be relased with the same version numbers as the Taskcluster services.

[minor] The web-server application now uses CORS headers to limit access to the `/graphql` and `/subscription` endpoints to requests from the root URL origin.
An additional, optional configuration value, `ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGIN`, provides a way to allow additional origins.
If it begins and ends with `/`, it is treated as a regular expression, allowing matching e.g., pull-request draft deployments.

[minor] What was previously the `/worker-pools-errors/:workerPoolId` API route is now spelled `/worker-pool-errors/:workerPoolId`.
This endpoint is still experimental so while this might someday be a breaking change, it is currently considered minor.

[minor] ([bug 1563341](http://bugzil.la/1563341)) Worker-manager now allows getting workers by worker group and singly by worker ID, and creating and removing workers (for some providers).
The static provider uses this capability to manage static workers, each authoritatively identified by a shared secret.

([bug 1547077](http://bugzil.la/1547077)) Emails now use the modern Taskcluster logo

The `GRAPHQL_SUBSCRIPTION_ENDPOINT` config for taskcluster-ui can now have scheme `http` or `https` instead of `ws`/`wss`.
This allows easier generation of this configuration as `${TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL}/subscription`.
The existing schemas are still accepted so no configuration change is required.

With the proper scopes, github repositories can now override the default scheduler. Adding custom schedulerId to the task definition while using github's Statuses API might break the status reporting functionality of tc-github in the case of successful build. Therefore, this only works with experimental `checks` status reporting.

## v14.2.0

[minor] The AWS Provisioner and Provisioner views are no longer available, as the AWS provisioner itself will be removed in favor of the worker manager service.

[minor] ([bug 1560649](http://bugzil.la/1560649)) The Go client is now hosted in the repository together with the services and other clients, and co-versioned with them.
See [the docs](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/master/clients/client-go#readme).

[minor] ([bug 1559471](http://bugzil.la/1559471)) The web-server configuration for sign-in now requires a single JWT HS256 key (`JWT_KEY`) instead of a public/private key (`JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`/`JWT_PUBLIC_KEY`).

Changes are now recorded in the CHANGELOG.mdx file.

([bug 1547729](http://bugzil.la/1547729)) Hook fire attempts are now logged using structured logging, including when a hook "declines" to create a task.

([bug 1556526](http://bugzil.la/1556526)) The `workerManager.updateWorkerType` API method now allows extra fields such as `lastModified`, making read-modify-write usages easier to implement.

The search box in the log viewer now searches on enter.

The task group inspector now shows the full task name.

([bug 1558346](http://bugzil.la/1558346)) Workers can now report errors directly to the worker manager for display in the worker-manager UI.
