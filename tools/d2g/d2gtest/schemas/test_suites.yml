            A test case contains a static input Docker Worker task payload, and an
            expected Generic Worker task payload output. The Docker Worker task payload
            is converted by d2g to a Generic Worker task payload. The test is successful
            if the generated Generic Worker task payload exactly matches the Generic
            Worker task payload in the test case.
