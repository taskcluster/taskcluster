          description: |-
            Artifacts can be either an individual `file` or a `directory` containing
            potentially multiple files with recursively included subdirectories.

        path:
          title: Artifact location
          type: string
          description: |-
            Relative path of the file/directory from the task directory. Note this is not an absolute
            path as is typically used in docker-worker, since the absolute task directory name is not
            known when the task is submitted. Example: `dist\regedit.exe`. It doesn't matter if
            forward slashes or backslashes are used.

        name:
          title: Name of the artifact
          type: string
          description: |-
            Name of the artifact, as it will be published. If not set, `path` will be used.
            Conventionally (although not enforced) path elements are forward slash separated. Example:
            `public/build/a/house`. Note, no scopes are required to read artifacts beginning `public/`.
            Artifact names not beginning `public/` are scope-protected (caller requires scopes to
            download the artifact). See the Queue documentation for more information.

        expires:
          title: Expiry date and time
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: |-
            Date when artifact should expire must be in the future, no earlier than task deadline, but
            no later than task expiry. If not set, defaults to task expiry.

            Since: generic-worker 1.0.0
        contentType:
          title: Content-Type header when serving artifact over HTTP
          type: string
          description: |-
            Explicitly set the value of the HTTP `Content-Type` response header when the artifact(s)
            is/are served over HTTP(S). If not provided (this property is optional) the worker will
            guess the content type of artifacts based on the filename extension of the file storing
            the artifact content. It does this by looking at the system filename-to-mimetype mappings
            defined in the Windows registry. Note, setting `contentType` on a directory artifact will
            apply the same contentType to all files contained in the directory.

            See [mime.TypeByExtension](https://godoc.org/mime#TypeByExtension).

        description: |-
          Artifacts named `public/chain-of-trust.json` and
          `public/chain-of-trust.json.sig` should be generated which will
          include information for downstream tasks to build a level of trust
          for the artifacts produced by the task and the environment it ran in.

        title: Run [taskcluster-proxy](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy) to allow tasks to dynamically proxy requests to taskcluster services
        description: |-
          The taskcluster proxy provides an easy and safe way to make authenticated
          taskcluster requests within the scope(s) of a particular task. See
          [the github project](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy) for more information.

      runAsAdministrator:
        type: boolean
        title: Run commands with UAC process elevation
        description: |-
          Runs commands with UAC elevation. Only set to true when UAC is
          enabled on the worker and Administrative privileges are required by
          task commands. When UAC is disabled on the worker, task commands will
          already run with full user privileges, and therefore a value of true
          will result in a malformed-payload task exception.

          A value of true does not add the task user to the `Administrators`
          group - see the `osGroups` property for that. Typically
          `task.payload.osGroups` should include an Administrative group, such
          as `Administrators`, when setting to true.

          For security, `runAsAdministrator` feature cannot be used in
          conjunction with `chainOfTrust` feature.

          Requires scope
          `generic-worker:run-as-administrator:<provisionerId>/<workerType>`.

  supersederUrl:
    type: string
    title: Superseder URL
    description: |-
      URL of a service that can indicate tasks superseding this one; the current `taskId`
      will be appended as a query argument `taskId`. The service should return an object with
      a `supersedes` key containing a list of `taskId`s, including the supplied `taskId`. The
      tasks should be ordered such that each task supersedes all tasks appearing later in the
      list.

      See [superseding](https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/superseding) for more detail.

  onExitStatus:
    title: Exit code handling
    description: |-
      By default tasks will be resolved with `state/reasonResolved`: `completed/completed`
      if all task commands have a zero exit code, or `failed/failed` if any command has a
      non-zero exit code. This payload property allows customsation of the task resolution
      based on exit code of task commands.

        title: Intermittent task exit codes
        description: |-
          Exit codes for any command in the task payload to cause this task to
          be resolved as `exception/intermittent-task`. Typically the Queue
          will then schedule a new run of the existing `taskId` (rerun) if not
          all task runs have been exhausted.

          See [itermittent tasks](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/worker-interaction#intermittent-tasks) for more detail.

  rdpInfo:
    type: string
    title: RDP Info
    description: |-
      Specifies an artifact name for publishing RDP connection information.

      Since this is potentially sensitive data, care should be taken to publish
      to a suitably locked down path, such as
      `login-identity/<login-identity>/rdpinfo.json` which is only readable for
      the given login identity (for example
      `login-identity/mozilla-ldap/pmoore@mozilla.com/rdpinfo.json`). See the
      [artifact namespace guide](https://docs.taskcluster.net/manual/design/namespaces#artifacts) for more information.

      Use of this feature requires scope
      `generic-worker:allow-rdp:<provisionerId>/<workerType>` which must be
      declared as a task scope.

      The RDP connection data is published during task startup so that a user
      may interact with the running task.

      The task environment will be retained for 12 hours after the task
      completes, to enable an interactive user to perform investigative tasks.
      After these 12 hours, the worker will delete the task's Windows user
      account, and then continue with other tasks.

      No guarantees are given about the resolution status of the interactive
      task, since the task is inherently non-reproducible and no automation
      should rely on this value.
