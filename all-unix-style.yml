          - file
          - directory
          description: |-
            Artifacts can be either an individual `file` or a `directory` containing
            potentially multiple files with recursively included subdirectories.

            Since: generic-worker 1.0.0
        path:
          title: Artifact location
          type: string
          description: |-
            Relative path of the file/directory from the task directory. Note this is not an absolute
            path as is typically used in docker-worker, since the absolute task directory name is not
            known when the task is submitted. Example: `dist\regedit.exe`. It doesn't matter if
            forward slashes or backslashes are used.

            Since: generic-worker 1.0.0
        name:
          title: Name of the artifact
          type: string
          description: |-
            Name of the artifact, as it will be published. If not set, `path` will be used.
            Conventionally (although not enforced) path elements are forward slash separated. Example:
            `public/build/a/house`. Note, no scopes are required to read artifacts beginning `public/`.
            Artifact names not beginning `public/` are scope-protected (caller requires scopes to
            download the artifact). See the Queue documentation for more information.

        expires:
          title: Expiry date and time
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: |-
            Date when artifact should expire must be in the future, no earlier than task deadline, but
            no later than task expiry. If not set, defaults to task expiry.

            Since: generic-worker 1.0.0
        contentType:
          title: Content-Type header when serving artifact over HTTP
          type: string
          description: |-
            Explicitly set the value of the HTTP `Content-Type` response header when the artifact(s)
            is/are served over HTTP(S). If not provided (this property is optional) the worker will
            guess the content type of artifacts based on the filename extension of the file storing
            the artifact content. It does this by looking at the system filename-to-mimetype mappings
            defined in multiple `mime.types` files located under `/etc`. Note, setting `contentType`
            on a directory artifact will apply the same contentType to all files contained in the
            directory.

            See [mime.TypeByExtension](https://godoc.org/mime#TypeByExtension).

          An artifact named `public/chainOfTrust.json.asc` should be generated
          which will include information for downstream tasks to build a level
          of trust for the artifacts produced by the task and the environment
          it ran in.

    title: Superseder URL
    description: |-
      URL of a service that can indicate tasks superseding this one; the current `taskId`
      will be appended as a query argument `taskId`. The service should return an object with
      a `supersedes` key containing a list of `taskId`s, including the supplied `taskId`. The
      tasks should be ordered such that each task supersedes all tasks appearing later in the
      list.

      See [superseding](https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/superseding) for more detail.
