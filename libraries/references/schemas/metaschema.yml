title: "Taskcluster JSON-Schema Meta-Schema, with some stricter validation"
description: |
  This is a refinement of JSON-schema, with the following changes:

    * if `properties` is present, `type` and `additionalProperties` must be present, too
    * if `entries` is present, `type` and `uniqueItems` must be present, too

  Note that any schema that validates against this metaschema will also
  validate against the upstream draft-06 metaschema, and is usable by any
  JSON-schema tool.
