          Metadata identifying the documents that the schema document describes,
          giving both a name (a category of document) and a version (to allow
          several versions of the same category).  Consumers of the documents can
          consult the schema metadata to determine how to process the document.
    
          Any changes to a schema that require changes to consumers of the described
          documents should be accompanied by a version increase.
