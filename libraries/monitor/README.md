# Monitor Library

A convenient library to wrap up all of the pieces needed for a Taskcluster service to record metrics and write structured logs.
By default it will report any errors that cause the process to exit, and report as warnings any errors that cause stats writing to not work.
To disable any of these, you can see the Options and Defaults section below.

Taskcluster has some generic concepts that are able to be monitored easily using utility functions in this package.
The Usage section lists these cases and shows how to use this package to measure them.

## Usage

This library is initialized early in the Node process's lifetime, while modules are still being loaded.
The MonitorManager class is instantiated as `defaultMonitorManager`, which is exported from this package.

At this time, two methods can be called: `register` (to register new log message types) and `configure` (to configure the instance for this service.

Typically this occurs in a service's `monitor.js`:
```js
const {defaultMonitorManager} = require('taskcluster-lib-monitor');

const monitorManager = defaultMonitorManager.configure({
  serviceName: 'someservice',
});

monitorManager.register({
  name: 'somethingHappened',
  title: 'Something Happened',
  type: 'something-happened',
  version: 1,
  level: 'info',
  description: 'A thing, it has occurred.',
  fields: {
    thing: 'The thing in question',
  },
});

module.exports = monitorManager;
```

Other Taskcluster libraries used by the service also register message types for messages that they send.

Once the service begins running, call the `setup` method on the monitor manager to get the "root" monitor instance.
This is typically done in a loader component:

```js
  monitor: {
    requires: ['process', 'profile', 'cfg'],
    setup: ({process, profile, cfg}) => monitorManager.setup({
      processName: process,
      verify: profile !== 'production',
      ...cfg.monitoring,
    }),
  },
```

That monitor can then be used to log, measure, count, or even create child monitors.

Typically the log references are passed to an instance of `taskcluster-lib-references`.

### configure

The available options to the manager's configure method are:

 * `serviceName` - The short name of this service.

### register

This library allows creating custom message types, and documents those in the service documentation.
To add a message type, do the following:

```js
monitorManager.register({
  name: 'email',
  title: 'Email Request',
  type: 'email',
  version: 1,
  level: 'info',
  description: 'A request to send an email.',
  fields: {
    address: 'The requested recepient of the email.',
  },
});

monitorManager.register({
  name: 'errorReport',
  title: 'Error Report',
  type: 'error-report',
  version: 1,
  level: 'any', // Notice that this is `any`
  description: 'A generic error report.',
  fields: {
    stack: 'A stack trace.',
  },
});
```

Given the above, the log message can be generated with

```js
monitor.log.email({address: req.body.address});
// An example with an `any` level
monitor.log.errorReport({stack: '...'}, {level: 'warning'});
```

The options to `register` are:

 * `name` - This will be made available on your monitor under a `.log` prefix.
 * `type` - This will be the `Type` field of the logged message.
 * `version` - This will end up in a `v` field of the `Fields` part of a logged message. Bump this if making a backwards-incompatible change
 * `level` - This will be the level that this message logs at. This must either be a syslog level or `any`. If it is `any`, you must pass an object with the
    field `level` as the second argument to the logging function.
 * `description` - A description of what this logging message means
 * `fields`: An object where every key is the name of a required field to be logged. Corresponding values are documentation of the meaning of that field.

If the `verify` option is set to true during manager setup, this library will verify that at least the required fields have been passed into the logger
upon invoking it.

### setup

The available options to the setup function are:

 * `level` - A syslog logging level. Any messages with less severity than this level will not be logged.
 * `patchGlobal` - If true (the default), any uncaught errors in the service will be reported.
 * `processName` - If set to a string that identifies this process, cpu and memory
    usage of the process will be reported on an interval.
 * `resourceInterval` - The interval (in seconds) on which to report process resources
 * `bailOnUnhandledRejection` - If true, exit the process when an unhandled rejection occurs (the default)
 * `fake` - If true, the monitoring object will be a fake that stores data for testing
 * `metadata` - an object of extra fields to attach to any logs generated by this object.
 * `debug` - If true, logging output will be sent to the `debug` log in a human-readable format
 * `destination` - A stream to which formatted logs should be written.
 * `verify` - If this is true, log messages that have been registered will be verified to define all of the required fields.
 * `errorConfig` - An optional object containing a `reporter` field and any arguments to pass to a reporter. See below.

### Error Configuration

This library supports pluggable error reporting. At the current time, the only supported plugin is `SentryReporter`. This will
send any errors reported through `monitor.reportError()` (including crashes and unhandled rejections) to a sentry instance. It
takes a single configration value of `dsn` which must be supplied.

```
errorConfig: {
  reporter: 'SentryReporter',
  dsn: '...',
},
```

## Monitor objects

Monitor objects are intended to be passed around to the various things that might need to submit data for monitoring.
The `setup` function returns a "root" monitor, and other "child" monitors can be created from the root.
The messages these child monitors produce will have a value of `Logger` corresponding to their name.

### Logging

A monitor instance provides the following functions:

```js
  emerg(type, fields) // Not recommended for use
  alert(type, fields)
  crit(type, fields)
  err(type, fields)
  warning(type, fields)
  notice(type, fields)
  info(type, fields)
  debug(type, fields)
```

If you leave out `type`, the first argument will be used for `fields`.
If fields is a string or number, we will log it in a generic message.
This is useful for something like simple debug logging, that can be enabled in production when necessary.
For example,

```js
monitor.debug('Whatever you want to say');
```

results in

```
{Fields: {message: 'Whatever you want to say'}, ...}
```

### Measuring and Counting Things

**Note: You should prefer logging specific types rather than these generic counts and measures. They exist mostly for backwards compatibility.**

To record a current measurement of a named value:

```js
monitor.measure('foo', 10);
```

To increment the count of some value:

```js
monitor.count('bar');
monitor.count('bar', 4); // increment by 4
```

These events will have types of `monitor.measure` and `monitor.count` respectively. The fields will have `key` and `val`.

### Reporting Errors

There are lots of options for reporting errors:

```js
// Report error as a string
monitor.reportError('Something went wrong!');
// Report error (from catch-block or something like that)
monitor.reportError(new Error("..."));
// Report an error with extra info
monitor.reportError(new Error("..."), {foo: 'bar'});
// (DEPRECATED) Report error as a warning. This will simply append 'warning' to fields
monitor.reportError(new Error("..."), 'warning');
```

### Monitoring CPU & Memory

```js
// Begin monitoring CPU & Memory
const stopMonitor = monitor.resources('web');
```
you can later call `stopMonitor()` to gracefully shut down the monitoring.

### Timing Functions/Promises

Often we wish to measure how long time an operation takes, synchronous or
asynchronous, this can done using the `monitor.timer(key, funcOrPromise)`
method. It takes a `key` (as name of the metric) and a function or promise to
measure the time of. If the function returns a promise, it'll include the time
it takes for the promise to resolve.

The following examples are valid usages:
```js
// Timing a synchronous operation
const root = monitor.timer('compute-sqrt', () => {
  return Math.sqrt(25);
})
assert(root === 5);

// Timing a single asynchronous function (promise)
const task = await monitor.timer('load-task', queue.task(taskId));
assert(task.workerType == '...'); // task is the task definition response

// Timing an asynchronous function
const task = await monitor.timer('poll-for-task', async () => {
  while (true) {
    try {
      return await queue.task(taskId);
    } catch (err) {
      // Ignore error and try again
      // In the real would you want a maximum time before you stop polling
      // And probably some sleeping between each polling attempt...
    }
  }
});
assert(task.workerType == '...'); // task is the task definition response

```

Rejected promises and errors will bubble up, and the time be will
measured and recoded just like successful functions or promises.

### Timing Handlers

A common pattern in Taskcluster projects is to have handler functions in a worker that take a message as an argument and perform some action. These
can be timed (in milliseconds) by wrapping them with `taskcluster-lib-monitor`:

```js
const handler = function(message) {
  console.log(message);
};

const consumer = libPulse.consume({..},
  monitor.timedHandler('pulse-listener', handler));
```

Specifically, `timedHandler` takes a function and wraps it with timing logic, returning a function with the same signature.

### Timing AWS SDK Calls

Oftentimes a lot of a service's time will be spent interacting with AWS services. These interactions can be measured
as in the following example:

```js
const aws = require('aws-sdk');
const ec2 = new aws.EC2({region: 'us-west-2'});
monitor.patchAWS(ec2);
await ec2.describeAvailabilityZones().promise().catch(err => {
  debug('Ignored ec2 error, we measure duration, not success, err: ', err);
});
```

### Timing Arbitary Steps

If none of the above options are convenient for you, you can also just start and stop timers whenever you want.
A timer may only be started and measured once.
Any attempts over that will cause it to throw an Error.

```js
const doodad = monitor.timeKeeper('metricName', {optional: 'extra data'});
// Do some stuff here that takes some amount of time
// ...
// Keep doing stuff here however long you like
doodad.measure();
```

### Monitoring One-Shot Processes

Many Taskcluster services use one-shot processes to expire old data.  The
expectation is that these processes will be started at specific times, do their
business, and exit.  The `oneShot` method is designed to wrap such processs
with timing and error handling support.

```javascript
  'expire-info': {
    requires: ['cfg', 'monitor'],
    setup: ({cfg, monitor}) => {
      return monitor.oneShot('expire-info', () => {
        // do the expiration stuff
      });
    },  
  },  
```

This function will:
 * time the invocation, measured as `duration`
 * count the invocation if successful, measured as `done`
 * report any errors or promise rejections
 * shut down and flush monitoring
 * call `process.exit` on success or failure
Note, then, that the function **does not return**.

# Testing

If the `fake` option is true, then all messges logged are available from the `messages` property on the MonitorManager, in the format `{Type, Fields, Logger, Severity}`.
Setting this up is generally handled by the [Testing](../testing) library's `withMonitor` method.

The accumulated messages can be cleared with the `reset()` method.
This allows tests to assert that a message was logged correctly:

```js
assert.deepEqual(helper.monitor.messages.find(({Type}) => Type === 'task-claimed'), {
  Type: 'task-claimed',
  Fields: {...}
});
```
# Level Configuration

If you set the level during setup to a single valid syslog level, it will be propagated to all child loggers.
If you would like more control, you can use a specifically formatted string:

```
LEVEL='root:info root.api:debug root.handler:warning'
```

When you use this format, you specify a prefix with `root` included and after a `:` you specify a valid syslog level.
You _must_ set a value for `root` in these cases and any unspecified prefixes will default to that.

# Mesage Format

This library writes logs to stdout in the [mozlog](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Services/Logging) format.

We add an extra `message` field to the top level if any of the contents of `Fields` are `message` or `stack`.
This is for compatibility with the logging tools we use. We will add configurable output formats later if wanted.

We have both a `Severity` and `severity` field to support both our logging tooling requiremtents and mozlog's.
The lowercase property reports in a string version of severity and uppercase is the syslog number for each level.

We also add a `serviceContext` which is used in our tooling.
This contains a single field with the name of the service, and the version.

The result looks like this:

```json
{
  "Timestamp": <time since unix epoch in nanoseconds>,
  "Type": "...",
  "Logger": "...",
  "message": "...",
  "serviceContext": {"service": "..."},
  "Hostname": "...",
  "EnvVersion": "2.0",
  "Severity": ...,
  "severity": ...,
  "Pid": ...,
  "Fields": {...}
}
```

The `type` will be set in the event object as the `Type` field in the mozlog format.
Everything in `fields` will be set in the `Fields`.
We default to `info` logging level so normally `debug` logs will not be logged.
