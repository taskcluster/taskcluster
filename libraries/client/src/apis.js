These API end-points are of interest if you wish to:\n  * Authorize a request signed with Taskcluster credentials,\n  * Manage clients and roles,\n  * Inspect or audit clients and roles,\n  * Gain access to various services guarded by this API.\n\nNote that in this service \"authentication\" refers to validating the\ncorrectness of the supplied credentials (that the caller posesses the\nappropriate access token). This service does not provide any kind of user\nauthentication (identifying a particular person).\n\n### Clients\nThe authentication service manages _clients_, at a high-level each client\nconsists of a `clientId`, an `accessToken`, scopes, and some metadata.\nThe `clientId` and `accessToken` can be used for authentication when\ncalling Taskcluster APIs.\n\nThe client's scopes control the client's access to Taskcluster resources.\nThe scopes are *expanded* by substituting roles, as defined below.\n\n### Roles\nA _role_ consists of a `roleId`, a set of scopes and a description.\nEach role constitutes a simple _expansion rule_ that says if you have\nthe scope: `assume:<roleId>` you get the set of scopes the role has.\nThink of the `assume:<roleId>` as a scope that allows a client to assume\na role.\n\nAs in scopes the `*` kleene star also have special meaning if it is\nlocated at the end of a `roleId`. If you have a role with the following\n`roleId`: `my-prefix*`, then any client which has a scope staring with\n`assume:my-prefix` will be allowed to assume the role.\n\n### Guarded Services\nThe authentication service also has API end-points for delegating access\nto some guarded service such as AWS S3, or Azure Table Storage.\nGenerally, we add API end-points to this server when we wish to use\nTaskcluster credentials to grant access to a third-party service used\nby many Taskcluster components.",

Please note that the `level`\nparameter is required in the scope guarding access.  The bucket name must\nnot contain `.`, as recommended by Amazon.\n\nThis method can only allow access to a whitelisted set of buckets.  To add\na bucket to that whitelist, contact the Taskcluster team, who will add it to\nthe appropriate IAM policy.  If the bucket is in a different AWS account, you\nwill also need to add a bucket policy allowing access from the Taskcluster\naccount.  That policy should look like this:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"allow-taskcluster-auth-to-delegate-access\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::692406183521:root\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:ListBucket\",\n        \"s3:GetObject\",\n        \"s3:PutObject\",\n        \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n        \"s3:GetBucketLocation\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe credentials are set to expire after an hour, but this behavior is\nsubject to change. Hence, you should always read the `expires` property\nfrom the response, if you intend to maintain active credentials in your\napplication.\n\nPlease note that your `prefix` may not start with slash `/`. Such a prefix\nis allowed on S3, but we forbid it here to discourage bad behavior.\n\nAlso note that if your `prefix` doesn't end in a slash `/`, the STS\ncredentials may allow access to unexpected keys, as S3 does not treat\nslashes specially.  For example, a prefix of `my-folder` will allow\naccess to `my-folder/file.txt` as expected, but also to `my-folder.txt`,\nwhich may not be intended.\n\nFinally, note that the `PutObjectAcl` call is not allowed.  Passing a canned\nACL other than `private` to `PutObject` is treated as a `PutObjectAcl` call, and\nwill result in an access-denied error from AWS.  This limitation is due to a\nsecurity flaw in Amazon S3 which might otherwise allow indefinite access to\nuploaded objects.\n\n**EC2 metadata compatibility**, if the querystring parameter\n`?format=iam-role-compat` is given, the response will be compatible\nwith the JSON exposed by the EC2 metadata service. This aims to ease\ncompatibility for libraries and tools built to auto-refresh credentials.\nFor details on the format returned by EC2 metadata service see:\n[EC2 User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#instance-metadata-security-credentials).",

This API can also perform basic instance\nmanagement tasks in addition to maintaining the internal state of worker type\nconfiguration information.\n\nThe Provisioner runs at a configurable interval.  Each iteration of the\nprovisioner fetches a current copy the state that the AWS EC2 api reports.  In\neach iteration, we ask the Queue how many tasks are pending for that worker\ntype.  Based on the number of tasks pending and the scaling ratio, we may\nsubmit requests for new instances.  We use pricing information, capacity and\nutility factor information to decide which instance type in which region would\nbe the optimal configuration.\n\nEach EC2 instance type will declare a capacity and utility factor.  Capacity is\nthe number of tasks that a given machine is capable of running concurrently.\nUtility factor is a relative measure of performance between two instance types.\nWe multiply the utility factor by the spot price to compare instance types and\nregions when making the bidding choices.\n\nWhen a new EC2 instance is instantiated, its user data contains a token in\n`securityToken` that can be used with the `getSecret` method to retrieve\nthe worker's credentials and any needed passwords or other restricted\ninformation.  The worker is responsible for deleting the secret after\nretrieving it, to prevent dissemination of the secret to other proceses\nwhich can read the instance user data.\n",

      "description": "The task index, typically available at `index.taskcluster.net`, is\nresponsible for indexing tasks. The service ensures that tasks can be\nlocated by recency and/or arbitrary strings. Common use-cases include:\n\n * Locate tasks by git or mercurial `<revision>`, or\n * Locate latest task from given `<branch>`, such as a release.\n\n**Index hierarchy**, tasks are indexed in a dot (`.`) separated hierarchy\ncalled a namespace. For example a task could be indexed with the index path\n`some-app.<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. In this case the following\nnamespaces is created.\n\n 1. `some-app`,\n 1. `some-app.<revision>`, and,\n 2. `some-app.<revision>.linux-64`\n\nInside the namespace `some-app.<revision>` you can find the namespace\n`some-app.<revision>.linux-64` inside which you can find the indexed task\n`some-app.<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. This is an example of indexing\nbuilds for a given platform and revision.\n\n**Task Rank**, when a task is indexed, it is assigned a `rank` (defaults\nto `0`). If another task is already indexed in the same namespace with\nlower or equal `rank`, the index for that task will be overwritten. For example\nconsider index path `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`. In\nthis case one might choose to use a UNIX timestamp or mercurial revision\nnumber as `rank`. This way the latest completed linux 64 bit release\nbuild is always available at `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`.\n\nNote that this does mean index paths are not immutable: the same path may\npoint to a different task now than it did a moment ago.\n\n**Indexed Data**, when a task is retrieved from the index the result includes\na `taskId` and an additional user-defined JSON blob that was indexed with\nthe task.\n\n**Entry Expiration**, all indexed entries must have an expiration date.\nTypically this defaults to one year, if not specified. If you are\nindexing tasks to make it easy to find artifacts, consider using the\nartifact's expiration date.\n\n**Valid Characters**, all keys in a namespace `<key1>.<key2>` must be\nin the form `/[a-zA-Z0-9_!~*'()%-]+/`. Observe that this is URL-safe and\nthat if you strictly want to put another character you can URL encode it.\n\n**Indexing Routes**, tasks can be indexed using the API below, but the\nmost common way to index tasks is adding a custom route to `task.routes` of the\nform `index.<namespace>`. In order to add this route to a task you'll\nneed the scope `queue:route:index.<namespace>`. When a task has\nthis route, it will be indexed when the task is **completed successfully**.\nThe task will be indexed with `rank`, `data` and `expires` as specified\nin `task.extra.index`. See the example below:\n\n```js\n{\n  payload:  { /* ... */ },\n  routes: [\n    // index.<namespace> prefixed routes, tasks CC'ed such a route will\n    // be indexed under the given <namespace>\n    \"index.mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build\",\n    \"index.<revision>.linux-64.release-build\"\n  ],\n  extra: {\n    // Optional details for indexing service\n    index: {\n      // Ordering, this taskId will overwrite any thing that has\n      // rank <= 4000 (defaults to zero)\n      rank:       4000,\n\n      // Specify when the entries expire (Defaults to 1 year)\n      expires:          new Date().toJSON(),\n\n      // A little informal data to store along with taskId\n      // (less 16 kb when encoded as JSON)\n      data: {\n        hgRevision:   \"...\",\n        commitMessae: \"...\",\n        whatever...\n      }\n    },\n    // Extra properties for other services...\n  }\n  // Other task properties...\n}\n```\n\n**Remark**, when indexing tasks using custom routes, it's also possible\nto listen for messages about these tasks. For\nexample one could bind to `route.index.some-app.*.release-build`,\nand pick up all messages about release builds. Hence, it is a\ngood idea to document task index hierarchies, as these make up extension\npoints in their own.",

          "description": "This API end-point creates an artifact for a specific run of a task. This\nshould **only** be used by a worker currently operating on this task, or\nfrom a process running within the task (ie. on the worker).\n\nAll artifacts must specify when they `expires`, the queue will\nautomatically take care of deleting artifacts past their\nexpiration point. This features makes it feasible to upload large\nintermediate artifacts from data processing applications, as the\nartifacts can be set to expire a few days later.\n\nWe currently support 3 different `storageType`s, each storage type have\nslightly different features and in some cases difference semantics.\nWe also have 2 deprecated `storageType`s which are only maintained for\nbackwards compatiability and should not be used in new implementations\n\n**Blob artifacts**, are useful for storing large files.  Currently, these\nare all stored in S3 but there are facilities for adding support for other\nbackends in futre.  A call for this type of artifact must provide information\nabout the file which will be uploaded.  This includes sha256 sums and sizes.\nThis method will return a list of general form HTTP requests which are signed\nby AWS S3 credentials managed by the Queue.  Once these requests are completed\nthe list of `ETag` values returned by the requests must be passed to the\nqueue `completeArtifact` method\n\n**S3 artifacts**, DEPRECATED is useful for static files which will be\nstored on S3. When creating an S3 artifact the queue will return a\npre-signed URL to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your\nartifact. Note that `PUT` request **must** specify the `content-length`\nheader and **must** give the `content-type` header the same value as in\nthe request to `createArtifact`.\n\n**Azure artifacts**, DEPRECATED are stored in _Azure Blob Storage_ service\nwhich given the consistency guarantees and API interface offered by Azure\nis more suitable for artifacts that will be modified during the execution\nof the task. For example docker-worker has a feature that persists the\ntask log to Azure Blob Storage every few seconds creating a somewhat\nlive log. A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL\nfeaturing a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),\nrefer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.\n**Warning: azure artifact is currently an experimental feature subject\nto changes and data-drops.**\n\n**Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts really only have a `url` property and\nwhen the artifact is requested the client will be redirect the URL\nprovided with a `303` (See Other) redirect. Please note that we cannot\ndelete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the\nreference to the artifact, when it expires.\n\n**Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the\nworker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you\nwould otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an\nerror artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or\nturns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will\nget a `424` (Failed Dependency) response. This is mainly designed to\nensure that dependent tasks can distinguish between artifacts that were\nsuppose to be generated and artifacts for which the name is misspelled.\n\n**Artifact immutability**, generally speaking you cannot overwrite an\nartifact when created. But if you repeat the request with the same\nproperties the request will succeed as the operation is idempotent.\nThis is useful if you need to refresh a signed URL while uploading.\nDo not abuse this to overwrite artifacts created by another entity!\nSuch as worker-host overwriting artifact created by worker-code.\n\nAs a special case the `url` property on _reference artifacts_ can be\nupdated. You should only use this to update the `url` property for\nreference artifacts your process has created.",

Either way, the response may not be JSON. So API\nclient users might want to generate a signed URL for this end-point and\nuse that URL with an HTTP client that can handle responses correctly.\n\n**Downloading artifacts**\nThere are some special considerations for those http clients which download\nartifacts.  This api endpoint is designed to be compatible with an HTTP 1.1\ncompliant client, but has extra features to ensure the download is valid.\nIt is strongly recommend that consumers use either taskcluster-lib-artifact (JS),\ntaskcluster-lib-artifact-go (Go) or the CLI written in Go to interact with\nartifacts.\n\nIn order to download an artifact the following must be done:\n\n1. Obtain queue url.  Building a signed url with a taskcluster client is\nrecommended\n1. Make a GET request which does not follow redirects\n1. In all cases, if specified, the\nx-taskcluster-location-{content,transfer}-{sha256,length} values must be\nvalidated to be equal to the Content-Length and Sha256 checksum of the\nfinal artifact downloaded. as well as any intermediate redirects\n1. If this response is a 500-series error, retry using an exponential\nbackoff.  No more than 5 retries should be attempted\n1. If this response is a 400-series error, treat it appropriately for\nyour context.  This might be an error in responding to this request or\nan Error storage type body.  This request should not be retried.\n1. If this response is a 200-series response, the response body is the artifact.\nIf the x-taskcluster-location-{content,transfer}-{sha256,length} and\nx-taskcluster-location-content-encoding are specified, they should match\nthis response body\n1. If the response type is a 300-series redirect, the artifact will be at the\nlocation specified by the `Location` header.  There are multiple artifact storage\ntypes which use a 300-series redirect.\n1. For all redirects followed, the user must verify that the content-sha256, content-length,\ntransfer-sha256, transfer-length and content-encoding match every further request.  The final\nartifact must also be validated against the values specified in the original queue response\n1. Caching of requests with an x-taskcluster-artifact-storage-type value of `reference`\nmust not occur\n1. A request which has x-taskcluster-artifact-storage-type value of `blob` and does not\nhave x-taskcluster-location-content-sha256 or x-taskcluster-location-content-length\nmust be treated as an error\n\n**Headers**\nThe following important headers are set on the response to this method:\n\n* location: the url of the artifact if a redirect is to be performed\n* x-taskcluster-artifact-storage-type: the storage type.  Example: blob, s3, error\n\nThe following important headers are set on responses to this method for Blob artifacts\n\n* x-taskcluster-location-content-sha256: the SHA256 of the artifact\n*after* any content-encoding is undone.  Sha256 is hex encoded (e.g. [0-9A-Fa-f]{64})\n* x-taskcluster-location-content-length: the number of bytes *after* any content-encoding\nis undone\n* x-taskcluster-location-transfer-sha256: the SHA256 of the artifact\n*before* any content-encoding is undone.  This is the SHA256 of what is sent over\nthe wire.  Sha256 is hex encoded (e.g. [0-9A-Fa-f]{64})\n* x-taskcluster-location-transfer-length: the number of bytes *after* any content-encoding\nis undone\n* x-taskcluster-location-content-encoding: the content-encoding used.  It will either\nbe `gzip` or `identity` right now.  This is hardcoded to a value set when the artifact\nwas created and no content-negotiation occurs\n* x-taskcluster-location-content-type: the content-type of the artifact\n\n**Caching**, artifacts may be cached in data centers closer to the\nworkers in-order to reduce bandwidth costs. This can lead to longer\nresponse times. Caching can be skipped by setting the header\n`x-taskcluster-skip-cache: true`, this should only be used for resources\nwhere request volume is known to be low, and caching not useful.\n(This feature may be disabled in the future, use is sparingly!)",

      "description": "The queue service is responsible for accepting tasks and track their state\nas they are executed by workers. In order ensure they are eventually\nresolved.\n\nThis document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows\nthird-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.\nThese exchanges targets the following audience:\n * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,\n * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),\n * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.\n\nYou'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same\nrouting key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages\nabout a certain kind tasks.\n\n**Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using\nthe `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details\non permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has\nthe entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in\n`task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the\nrouting-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.\n\nThese routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere\nwith the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the\n_primary_ routing key is always prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured\nin the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.\n\nPlease, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive\nin your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with\nmultiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing\nrouting keys.\n\n**Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,\nwhich means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests\nwill ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.\nThis is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but\nwhen re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend\nany related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.\n\nThis shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using\nconfirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,\nthis only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.\n\n**Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the\nserver crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the\nfuture. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us\nif this corner case is of concern to you.",
