In order ensure they are eventually resolved.\n\nThis document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows\nthird-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.\nThese exchanges targets the following audience:\n * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,\n * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),\n * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.\n\nYou'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same\nrouting key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all message about\na certain kind tasks. You should also note that the `routing` property\nof a task will be used in the routing key. This property is user-defined\nand may contain dots (ie. multiple routing words).\n\n**Task-Graphs**, if the task-graph scheduler, documented elsewhere, is\nused to schedule a task-graph, the task submitted will have their\n`schedulerId` set to `task-graph-scheduler`, and their `taskGroupId` to\nthe `taskGraphId` as given to the task-graph scheduler. This is useful if\nyou wish to listen for all messages in a specific task-graph.\n\n**Delivery Guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,\nwhich means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests\nwill ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.\nThis is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but\nwhen re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend\nany related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.\n\nThis shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using\nconfirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,\nthis only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.\n\n**Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the\nserver crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the\nfuture. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case.",

          "description": "Create a new task-graph, the `status` of the resulting JSON is a\ntask-graph status structure, you can find the `taskGraphId` in this\nstructure.\n\n**Referencing required tasks**, it is possible to reference other tasks\nin the task-graph that must be completed successfully before a task is\nscheduled. You just specify the `taskId` in the list of `required` tasks.\nSee the example below, where the second task requires the first task.\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  tasks: [\n    {\n      taskId:     \"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\",\n      requires:   [],\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      taskId:     \"73GsfK62QNKAk2Hg1EEZTQ\",\n      requires:   [\"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\"],\n      task: {\n        payload: {\n          env: {\n            DEPENDS_ON:  \"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\"\n          }\n          ...\n        }\n        ...\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Providing `schedulerId`**, the `schedulerId` on all task definitions\ngiven must be the `schedulerId` for the task-graph scheduler. In\nproduction this is `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`. A task-graph that doesn't\nhave this will not be accepted by the task-graph scheduler.\n\n**Providing `taskGroupId`**, the `taskGroupId` on all task definitions\ngiven must be the `taskGraphId` for this task-graph. A task-graph that\ndoesn't have this will not be accepted by the task-graph scheduler.\n\n**Task-graph scopes**, a task-graph is assigned a set of scopes, just\nlike tasks. Tasks within a task-graph cannot have scopes beyond those\nthe task-graph has. The task-graph scheduler will execute all requests\non behalf of a task-graph using the set of scopes assigned to the\ntask-graph. Thus, if you are submitting tasks to `my-worker-type` under\n`my-provisioner` it's important that your task-graph has the scope\nrequired to define tasks for this `provisionerId` and `workerType`.\nSee the queue for details on permissions required. Note, the task-graph\ndoes not require permissions to schedule the tasks. This is done with\nscopes provided by the task-graph scheduler.",

These exchanges targets the following audience:\n * Reporters, who displays the state of task-graphs or emails people on\n   failures, and\n * End-users, who wants notification of completed task-graphs\n\n**Remark**, the task-graph scheduler will require that the `schedulerId`\nfor tasks is set to the `schedulerId` for the task-graph scheduler. In\nproduction the `schedulerId` is typically `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`.\nFurthermore, the task-graph scheduler will also require that\n`taskGroupId` is equal to the `taskGraphId`.\n\nCombined these ensures that `schedulerId` and `taskGroupId`\nhave the same position in the routing keys for the queue exchanges.\nSee queue documentation for details on queue exchanges. Hence, making\nit easy to listen for all tasks in a given task-graph.\n\nNote that the first 6 routing key entries used for exchanges on the\ntask-graph scheduler is hardcoded to `_`.

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.

                               Only used when passed a node Http.ServerRequest object.
  
        nonceFunc:             optional nonce validation function. The function signature is function(nonce, ts, callback)
                               where 'callback' must be called using the signature function(err).

                               Provides a +/- skew which means actual allowed window is double the number of seconds.
  
        localtimeOffsetMsec:   optional local clock time offset express in a number of milliseconds (positive or negative).
                               Defaults to 0.
  
        payload:               optional payload for validation. The client calculates the hash value and includes it via the 'hash'
                               header attribute. The server always ensures the value provided has been included in the request
                               MAC. When this option is provided, it validates the hash value itself. Validation is done by calculating
                               a hash value over the entire payload (assuming it has already be normalized to the same format and
                               encoding used by the client to calculate the hash on request). If the payload is not available at the time
                               of authentication, the authenticatePayload() method can be used by passing it the credentials and
                               attributes.hash returned in the authenticate callback.

        host:                  optional host name override. Only used when passed a node request object.
