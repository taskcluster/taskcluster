TaskCluster-Lib-Testing
=======================

Support for testing TaskCluster components.

This module contains a number of utilities that facilitate testing TaskCluster
components.  It is typically installed as a devDependency, so it is not used in
production code.

See the source for detailed documentation.

Sticky Loader
-------------

A sticky loader is a thin wrapper around `taskcluster-lib-loader` to support
dependency injection. It "remembers" each value it has returned and will return
it again on the next call; it can also have a dependency injected.  Use it like
this in `helper.js`:

```javascript
const {stickyLoader} = require('taskcluster-lib-testing');
const load = require('../src/server');

exports.load = stickyLoader(load);
exports.load.inject('profile', 'test');
exports.load.inject('process', 'test');
```

The `load.inject(component, value)` method sets a loader overwrite without
attempting to load it. There is a corresponding `load.remove(component)` to
remove a component.

The last line of this `suiteSetup` is important: it loads the `cfg` component
so that the configuration can be edited in-place (stickyLoader has special
support for a component with this name).  If `cfg` is not loaded, the
`load.cfg()` method will not work.

In test scripts:

```javascript
const {load} = require('./helper');

suite('SomeTable', function() {
  suiteSetup(async function() {
    load.save(); // save the state of the loader to restore in tearDown
    load.cfg('azure.accountName', 'inMemory'); // edit the cfg in-place
    const SomeTable = await load('SomeTable');
    await SomeTable.ensureTable({ /* ... */ });
  });

  suiteTeardown(function() {
    load.restore(); // restore the state of the loader
  });

  test(async function() {
    const component = await load('some-component');
    // some-component will be loaded with the same cfg and with
    // the same instance of SomeTable that we set up above
  });
});
```

The `load.save()` and `load.restore()` methods push and pull loader states in a
stack, and are best used in setup/teardown methods to ensure that one suite
does not "pollute" the loader state for the next.

The `load.cfg(path, value)` method edits the `cfg` component in place, using a
dotted path to specify the config value. The `save` and `restore` methods are
careful to deep-copy `cfg` so that these in-place modifications affect only
the current loader state.

Secrets
-------

This class handles getting secrets for tests, and easily determining what
secrets are available.  It integrates with `typed-env-config`.  Set it up by
in `test/helper.js`:

```javascript
const {Secrets} = require('taskcluster-lib-testing');

exports.secrets = new Secrets({
  secretName: 'project/taskcluster/testing/taskcluster-lib-foo',
  // provide a stickyLoader instance for use in mockSuite
  load,
  secrets: {
   pulse: [
     // env - the environment variable by which this secret is set in the config (if any)
     // cfg - dotted path to the config value containing this secret (if any)
     // name - name for the secret (used for programmatic access in tests; defaults to env)
     // mock - value to provide if secret is not set (for mock runs only)
     {env: 'PULSE_USERNAME', cfg: 'pulse.username', name: 'username', mock: 'dummy'},
     {env: 'PULSE_PASSWORD', cfg: 'pulse.password', name: 'password'},
   ],
   aws: [
     {env: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', cfg: 'aws.accessKeyId'},
     {env: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', cfg: 'aws.secretAccessKey'},
   ],
  },
});
```

If a secret is defined in the loaded configuration, that value will be used even if the `env` key is also set.
Secrets should not have any value set in `config.yml` (although `!env` is OK), or this class will not function properly.
If the system you are testing does not use `typed-env-config`, simply do not specify the `cfg` properties to the constructor.

You can then call `await secrets.setup()`  to set up the secrets (reading from `cfg` if necessary).
This *must* be called during Mocha's runtime, so either in a setup function or a test.
It short-circuits multiple calls, so it's safe to call it all over the place.
In fact, `mockSuite` (below) will call it for you.

The secrets object has a few useful methods, all of which can only be called *after* `setup`, and thus only in a setup function or a test:

* `secrets.have(name)` -- true if the given secret is available
* `secrets.get(name)` -- returns an object containing the secret values by name, or throws an error if not avaialble

## mockSuite

The `secrets.mockSuite` function abstracts away the most common case: running the same tests in a mock and real environment, skipping the real tests if secrets are not available.
It is called as `secrets.mockSuite(title, [secrets], async function(mock, skipping) { .. })` in the same location you might call Mocha's `suite(..)`.
The `secrets` is an array of secret names required to run this suite in a real environment.
The given function should define the suite, and can include `setup`, `suiteSetup`, and so on.
The `mock` parameter is true for the mock version, and false for the real version.
If `$NO_TEST_SKIP` is set, `mockSuite` will throw an error when secrets are not available.

Note that Mocha continues to run `setupSuite` and `teardownSuite` functions even after a suite has been skipped.
Mocha does not provide any way to determine if a suite has been skipped.
Use `skipping()` to determine if the suite is currently skipping, and avoid doing initialization that will fail.

Note, too, that all modern versions of Mocha have [a bug](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2819) causing nested suites to run anyway, even when the parent suite is skipped.
A quick (but unfortunate) way to work around this bug is

```javascript
suite('mySuite', function() {
  suiteSetup(function() {
    if (skipping()) {
      this.skip();
    }
  });
});
```

### Usage

```javascript
// helper.js
const {Secrets, stickyLoader} = require('taskcluster-lib-testing');

const load = stickyLoader(require('../src/main'));
const secrets = new Secrets({
  secretName: 'project/taskcluster/testing/taskcluster-ping',
  secrets: {
    pingdom: [
      {name: 'apiKey', env: 'PINGDOM_API_KEY', cfg: 'app.pingdom.apiKey'},
    ],
    taskcluster: [
      {name: 'clientId', env: 'TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID', cfg: 'taskcluster.credentials.clientId'},
      {name: 'accessToken', env: 'TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN', cfg: 'taskcluster.credentials.accessToken'},
    ],
  },
  load,
});

exports.secrets = secrets;
exports.load = load;
```

```javascript
// some_test.js
const {secrets, load} = require('./helper');

// for testing by passing secrets to the subject..
secrets.mockSuite('pingdom updates', ['pingdom'], function(mock, skipping) {
  let pingdomUpdater, pingdomComponent;

  suiteSetup(async function() {
    // use secrets.get(..) in the real case
    pingdomUpdater = new PingdomUpdater({apiKey: mock ? 'pretendKey' : secrets.get('pingdom').apiKey});
    if (mock) {
      nock('https://pingdom.com:443', ..); // mock out Pingdom API
    }
  });

  suiteTeardown(function() {
    if (mock) {
      nock.clearAll();
    }
  });

  test('updates once', function() { .. });
});

// for testing a loader component..
secrets.mockSuite('Floobits', ['taskcluster'], function(mock) {
  let Floobits;
  suiteSetup(async function() {
    if (mock) {
      // set the special accountName that will cause azure-entities to use its fake version;
      // otherwise, the loader component will use the taskcluster secrets to get access
      // to the a Azure table
      helper.load.cfg('azure.accountName', 'inMemory');
    }
    
    if (!skipping()) {
      Floobits = await helper.load('Floobits');
      await Floobits.ensureTable();
    }
  });

  test('create', async function() {
    await Floobits.create(..);
    // ..
  });
});
```

The test output for the first suite will contain something like

```
  pingdom updates (mock)
    âœ“ updates once
  pingdom updates (real)
    - updates once
```


PulseTestReceiver
-----------------

A utility for tests written in mocha, that makes it very easy to wait for a
specific pulse message.  This uses real pulse messages, so pulse credentials
will be required.

**Example:**
```js
suite("MyTests", function() {
  let credentials = {
    username:     '...',  // Pulse username
    password:     '...'   // Pulse password
  };
  let receiver = new testing.PulseTestReceiver(credentials, mocha)

  test("create task message arrives", async function() {
    var taskId = slugid.v4();

    // Start listening for a message with the above taskId, giving
    // it a local name (here, `my-create-task-message`)
    await receiver.listenFor(
      'my-create-task-message',
      queueEvents.taskCreated({taskId: taskId})
    );

    // We are now listen for a message with the taskId
    // So let's create a task with it
    await queue.createTask(taskId, {...});

    // Now we wait for the message to arrive
    let message = await receiver.waitFor('my-create-task-message');
  });
});
```

The `receiver` object will setup an PulseConnection before all tests and close
the PulseConnection after all tests. This should make tests run faster.  All
internal state, ie. the names given to `listenFor` and `waitFor` will be reset
between all tests.

schemas
-------

Test schemas with a positive and negative test cases.

The method should be called within a `suite`, as it will call the mocha `test`
function to define a test for each schema case.

 * `validator` - {}  // options to pass to the [taskcluster-lib-validate](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-validate) constructor
 * `cases` - array of test cases
 * `basePath` -  base path for relative pathnames in test cases (default `path.join(__dirname, 'validate')`)

Each test case looks like this:

```js
{
  schema:   'https://tc-tests.localhost/svcname/v7/frobnicate-foo.json', // JSON schema identifier to test against
  path:     'test-file.json',             // Path to test file (relative to basePath)
  success:  true || false                 // true if validation should succeed; false if it should fail
}
```

fakeauth
--------

A fake for the auth service to support testing APIs without requiring
production credentials, using Nock.

This object intercepts requests to the auth service's `authenticateHawk` method
and returns a response based on the given `clients`, instead. Note that
accessTokens are not checked -- the fake simply controls access based on
clientId or the scopes in a temporary credential or supplied with
authorizedScopes.

To start the mock, call `testing.fakeauth.start(clients, {rootUrl})` in your suite's
`setup` method. The first argument has the form

```js
{
 "clientId1": ["scope1", "scope2"],
 "clientId2": ["scope1", "scope3"],
}
```

The auth service on the cluster identified by `rootUrl` will be faked. When
used to test an API in a microservice, this is same as the root URL for the
fake web server -- `http://localhost:1234` or something of that sort.

Call `testing.fakeauth.stop()` in your test suite's `teardown` method to stop the HTTP interceptor.

Utilities
---------

### Sleep

The `sleep` function returns a promise that resolves after a delay.

**NOTE** tests that depend on timing are notoriously unreliable, and suggest
poorly-isolated tests. Consider writing the tests to use a "fake" clock or to
poll for the expected state.

### Poll

The `poll` function will repeatedly call a function that returns a promise
until the promise is resolved without errors.

```javascript
await poll(
  maybeFunc, // function to be called
  11,        // max times to try it
  100);      // delay (ms) between tries
```
