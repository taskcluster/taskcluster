# Testing Library

Support for testing Taskcluster components.

This module contains a number of utilities that facilitate testing Taskcluster
components.  It is typically installed as a devDependency, so it is not used in
production code.

See the source for detailed documentation.

Sticky Loader
-------------

A sticky loader is a thin wrapper around `taskcluster-lib-loader` to support
dependency injection. It "remembers" each value it has returned and will return
it again on the next call; it can also have a dependency injected.  Use it like
this in `helper.js`:

```javascript
import { stickyLoader } from 'taskcluster-lib-testing';
import _load from '../src/server.js';

export const load = stickyLoader(_load);
load.inject('profile', 'test');
load.inject('process', 'test');
```

The `load.inject(component, value)` method sets a loader overwrite without
attempting to load it. There is a corresponding `load.remove(component)` to
remove a component.

In test scripts:

```javascript
import { load } from './helper.js';

suite('SomeTable', function() {
  suiteSetup(async function() {
    load.save(); // save the state of the loader to restore in tearDown
    await load('cfg'); // load the cfg so we can edit it
    load.cfg('azure.accountName', 'inMemory'); // edit the cfg in-place
    const SomeTable = await load('SomeTable');
    await SomeTable.ensureTable({ /* ... */ });
  });

  suiteTeardown(function() {
    load.restore(); // restore the state of the loader
  });

  test(async function() {
    const component = await load('some-component');
    // some-component will be loaded with the same cfg and with
    // the same instance of SomeTable that we set up above
  });
});
```


The `load.save()` and `load.restore()` methods push and pull loader states in a
stack, and are best used in setup/teardown methods to ensure that one suite
does not "pollute" the loader state for the next.

The `load.cfg(path, value)` method edits the `cfg` component in place, using a
dotted path to specify the config value. The `save` and `restore` methods are
careful to deep-copy `cfg` so that these in-place modifications affect only
the current loader state.

If `cfg` is not loaded, the `load.cfg()` method will not work, so generally (as
in the example above) a bare `load('cfg')` is used to ensure its presence.

Secrets
-------

This class handles getting secrets for tests, and easily determining what
secrets are available.  It integrates with `taskcluster-lib-config`.  Set it up by
in `test/helper.js`:

```javascript
import { Secrets } from 'taskcluster-lib-testing';

export const secrets = new Secrets({
  secretName: [
    'project/taskcluster/testing/taskcluster-foo',
    'project/taskcluster/testing/taskcluster-foo/main-only',
  ],
  // (optional) provide a stickyLoader instance for use in mockSuite
  load,
  secrets: {
   pulse: [
     // env - the environment variable by which this secret is set in the config (if any)
     // cfg - dotted path to the config value containing this secret (if any)
     // name - name for the secret (used for programmatic access in tests; defaults to env)
     // mock - value to provide if secret is not set (for mock runs only)
     {env: 'PULSE_USERNAME', cfg: 'pulse.username', name: 'username', mock: 'dummy'},
     {env: 'PULSE_PASSWORD', cfg: 'pulse.password', name: 'password'},
   ],
   aws: [
     {env: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', cfg: 'aws.accessKeyId'},
     {env: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', cfg: 'aws.secretAccessKey'},
   ],
  },
});
```

If a secret is defined in the loaded configuration, that value will be used even if the `env` key is also set.
Secrets should not have any value set in `config.yml` (although `!env` is OK), or this class will not function properly.
If the system you are testing does not use `taskcluster-lib-config`, simply do not specify the `cfg` properties to the constructor.
You can also leave out `load` in this case.

You can then call `await secrets.setup()`  to set up the secrets (reading from `cfg` if necessary).
This *must* be called during Mocha's runtime, so either in a setup function or a test.
It short-circuits multiple calls, so it's safe to call it all over the place.
In fact, `mockSuite` (below) will call it for you.

In CI (when `$TASK_ID` is set), the `setup` method will attempt to fetch the secrets named in `secretName` from the secrets service.
It expects the fetch value to be a map from environment variable name to value.
If a fetch fails, it is considered equivalent to fetching an empty map.
This allows, for example, secrets that can only be fetched on pushes to the `main` branch, and not pull requests.

The secrets object has a few useful methods, all of which can only be called *after* `setup`, and thus only in a setup function or a test:

* `secrets.have(name)` -- true if the given secret is available
* `secrets.get(name)` -- returns an object containing the secret values by name, or throws an error if not avaialble

## mockSuite

The `secrets.mockSuite` function abstracts away the most common case: running the same tests in a mock and real environment, skipping the real tests if secrets are not available.
It is called as `secrets.mockSuite(title, [secrets], async function(mock, skipping) { .. })` in the same location you might call Mocha's `suite(..)`.
The `secrets` is an array of secret names required to run this suite in a real environment.
The given function should define the suite, and can include `setup`, `suiteSetup`, and so on.
The `mock` parameter is true for the mock version, and false for the real version.
If `$NO_TEST_SKIP` is set, `mockSuite` will throw an error when secrets are not available.

Note that Mocha continues to run `setupSuite` and `teardownSuite` functions even after a suite has been skipped.
Mocha does not provide any way to determine if a suite has been skipped.
Use `skipping()` to determine if the suite is currently skipping, and avoid doing initialization that will fail.

Note, too, that all modern versions of Mocha have [a bug](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2819) causing nested suites to run anyway, even when the parent suite is skipped.
A quick (but unfortunate) way to work around this bug is

```javascript
secrets.mockSuite('mySuite', [..], function(mock, skipping) {
  suiteSetup(function() {
    if (skipping()) {
      this.skip();
    }
  });
});
```

### Usage

```javascript
// helper.js
import { Secrets, stickyLoader } from 'taskcluster-lib-testing';
import _load from '../src/main.js';

export const load = stickyLoader(_load);
export const secrets = new Secrets({
  secretName: 'project/taskcluster/testing/taskcluster-ping',
  secrets: {
    pingdom: [
      {name: 'apiKey', env: 'PINGDOM_API_KEY', cfg: 'app.pingdom.apiKey'},
    ],
    taskcluster: [
      {name: 'clientId', env: 'TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID', cfg: 'taskcluster.credentials.clientId'},
      {name: 'accessToken', env: 'TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN', cfg: 'taskcluster.credentials.accessToken'},
    ],
  },
  load,
});
```

```javascript
// some_test.js
import { secrets, load } from './helper.js';

// for testing by passing secrets to the subject..
secrets.mockSuite('pingdom updates', ['pingdom'], function(mock, skipping) {
  let pingdomUpdater, pingdomComponent;

  suiteSetup(async function() {
    // use secrets.get(..) in the real case
    pingdomUpdater = new PingdomUpdater({apiKey: mock ? 'pretendKey' : secrets.get('pingdom').apiKey});
    if (mock) {
      nock('https://pingdom.com:443', ..); // mock out Pingdom API
    }
  });

  suiteTeardown(function() {
    if (mock) {
      nock.clearAll();
    }
  });

  test('updates once', function() { .. });
});

// for testing a loader component..
secrets.mockSuite('Floobits', ['taskcluster'], function(mock, skipping) {
  let Floobits;
  suiteSetup(async function() {
    if (mock) {
      // set the special accountName that will cause azure-entities to use its fake version;
      // otherwise, the loader component will use the taskcluster secrets to get access
      // to the a Azure table
      helper.load.cfg('azure.accountName', 'inMemory');
    }

    if (!skipping()) {
      Floobits = await helper.load('Floobits');
      await Floobits.ensureTable();
    }
  });

  test('create', async function() {
    await Floobits.create(..);
    // ..
  });
});
```

The test output for the first suite will contain something like

```
  pingdom updates (mock)
    âœ“ updates once
  pingdom updates (real)
    - updates once
```

Note that even in cases where no secrets are required, `mockSuite` is still
useful for providing the `mock, skipping` values required by other components
of taskcluster-lib-testing.

schemas
-------

Test schemas with a positive and negative test cases.

The method should be called within a `suite`, as it will call the mocha `test`
function to define a test for each schema case.

 * `schemasetOptions` - {}  // options to pass to the [taskcluster-lib-validate](../validate) constructor
 * `cases` - array of test cases
 * `basePath` -  base path for relative pathnames in test cases (default `path.join(__dirname, 'validate')`)

Each test case looks like this:

```js
{
  schema:   'https://tc-tests.localhost/svcname/v7/frobnicate-foo.json', // JSON schema identifier to test against
  path:     'test-file.json',             // Path to test file (relative to basePath)
  success:  true || false                 // true if validation should succeed; false if it should fail
}
```

fakeauth
--------

A fake for the auth service to support testing APIs without requiring
production credentials, using Nock.

This object intercepts requests to the auth service's `authenticateHawk` method
and returns a response based on the given `clients`, instead. Note that
accessTokens are not checked -- the fake simply controls access based on
clientId or the scopes in a temporary credential or supplied with
authorizedScopes.

To start the mock, call `testing.fakeauth.start(clients, {rootUrl})` in your suite's
`setup` method. The first argument has the form

```js
{
 "clientId1": ["scope1", "scope2"],
 "clientId2": ["scope1", "scope3"],
}
```

The auth service on the cluster identified by `rootUrl` will be faked. When
used to test an API in a microservice, this is same as the root URL for the
fake web server -- `http://localhost:1234` or something of that sort.

Call `testing.fakeauth.stop()` in your test suite's `teardown` method to stop the HTTP interceptor.

In cases where you must test that HTTP requests without credentials are properly authenticated, for example, to test a webhook.
To achieve this, temporarily set the anonymous scopes with

```js
testing.fakeauth.withAnonymousScopes(['some-scope'], async () => {
  ..; // make the credential-free call
});
```

withDb
------

This function is intended for use with [usual configuration](../../db) for Postgres databases.
It sets up a "real" database using `$TEST_DB_URL`, accessed with a user corresponding to the given serviceName.
If `$TEST_DB_URL` is not set, it will exit during test setup.
The database is upgraded to the latest version at the beginning of the suite.
The resulting database is injected into the taskcluster-lib-loader as `db` and also available as `helper.db`.

It is up to the test suite implementation to reset the contents of the database between tests.
Ideally this is done via `helper.db.fns` methods.
If a client that can execute SQL directly is required, use `await helper.withDbClient(async client => { .. })`.
That method will use a connection from the per-service DB pool, meaning that it is limited by the service's DB permissions.
The similar `await helper.withAdminDbClient(async client => { .. })` will create a new connection using the administrative credentials.

Note that this is intended to operate against a temporary Postgres server such as one running in a docker container.
It's not a good idea to run this against a "real" Postgres server.
In particular, it will create a bunch of users with names beginning with `test_` (global to the server) and reset their passwords and access.

The function is typically used like this:

```javascript
// helper.js
const helper = { load };
helper.secrets = new Secrets({
  // ...
});

helper.withDb = (mock, skipping) => {
  withDb(mock, skipping, helper, 'my-service');
};
```

```javascript
// some_test.js
helper.secrets.mockSuite(testing.suiteName(), [], function(mock, skipping) {
  helper.withDb(mock, skipping);
  ...
});
```

Note that, while it takes `mock, skipping` like other utilities in this library, `withDb` *always* uses a real Postgres DB.

There is also a utility function, `resetTables`, which will truncate a list of tables.
This is typically used in a `setup` function to start each test with a clean slate.

```js
import { resetTables } from 'taskcluster-lib-testing';

export const resetTables = (mock, skipping) => {
  setup('reset tables', async function() {
    await resetTables({tableNames: [
      'some_table',
      'another_table',
    ]});
  });
};
```

Finally, to completely reset the DB to an empty state (but with per-service users defined), call `resetDb`:

```javascript
import { resetDb } from 'taskcluster-lib-testing';

// this automatically uses TEST_DB_URL.
await resetDb();
```

withPulse
---------

This function helps test applications that publish pulse messages.
It is typically set up in `test/helper.js` like this:

```js
import testing from 'taskcluster-lib-testing';
const helper = { load };
export const withPulse = (mock, skipping) => {
  testing.withPulse({helper, skipping, namespace: 'taskcluster-someservice'});
};
```

It assumes that `helper.loader` is set up as a sticky loader, and that there is a loader component named `pulseClient`.
It replaces this client with a fake version, for which `libPulse.consume()` and `exchanges.publisher()` will produce fake consumers and publishers, respectively.
The fake client can be identified by having a truthy `isFakeClient` property.

For fake publishers, it offers the following:

 * `onPulsePublish(callback)` - call the given function when a pulse message is published. This is useful to raise exceptions on publishing.
   The callback is called with (exchange, routingKey, payload, CCs).
 * `assertPulseMessage(exchange, check)` - assert that a matching message has been sent to pulse.
   The optional `exchange` is a suffix of the expected exchange (just the portion after `/v1/`); all messages will match if omitted.
   The optional `check` function is called with each message on that exchange and should return true for matching messages.
 * `assertNoPulseMessage(exchange, check)` - the opposite of `assertPulseMessage`
 * `clearPulseMessages` - clear the accumulated pulse messages.
   This is useful when you expect duplicte messages: asert that the first one was sent, then clear, then assert that the second was sent.

Messages are reset before each test case.

To simulate receipt of a pulse message by a consumer, call `await helper.fakePulseMessage({exchange, routingKey, routes, payload})`.
The message will be routed to consumers with matching bindings.

A consumer for which bindings are changed at runtime, using amqplib functions `bindQueue` and `unbindQueue`, can be faked by calling `consumer.setFakeBindings(bindings)`.

withMonitor
-----------

All services should call `testing.withMonitor(helper)` to set up the [`taskcluster-lib-monitor`](../monitor) loader component for testing.
Call this method at the module level, such as within `helper.js`, not as a part of each test suite.

The function does the following:
 * Set up the default MonitorManager instance to log via the `debug` module in a human-readable fashion, and to record messages (`mock=True`).
 * Fail if there are any messages at the ERROR level or higher at the completion of each test case.  Tests that generate errors should check for and remove them.
 * Reset the list of stored messages after each test.

Tests should import the MonitorManager instance from `../src/monitor.js` to get access to the messages and modify the message list

Libraries can use this function as
```js
withMonitor({ load }, {noLoader: true});
```

Time
----

### Sleep

The `sleep` function returns a promise that resolves after a delay.

**NOTE** tests that depend on timing are notoriously unreliable, and suggest
poorly-isolated tests. Consider writing the tests to use a "fake" clock or to
poll for the expected state.

### Fake Time

When testing functionality that involves timers, it is helpful to be able to simulate the rapid passage of time.
The `testing.runWithFakeTime(<fn>, {mock, maxTime, ...})` uses [zurvan](https://github.com/tlewowski/zurvan) to do just that.
It is used to wrap an argument to a Mocha `test` function, avoiding interfering with Mocha's timers:
```js
test('noun should verb', runWithFakeTime(async function() {
  ...
}, {
  mock,
  maxTime: 60000,
}));
```

The `maxTime` option is the total amount of simulated time to spend running the test; it defaults to 30 seconds.

The `mock` option is for use with `mockSuite` and can be omitted otherwise.
Fake time is only used when mocking; in a real situation, we are interacting with real services and must use the same clock they do.

Any other options are passed directly to zurvan.

Utilities
---------

### Poll

The `poll` function will repeatedly call a function that returns a promise
until the promise is resolved without errors.

```javascript
await poll(
  maybeFunc, // function to be called
  11,        // max times to try it
  100);      // delay (ms) between tries
```
