title: Building Taskcluster
order: 10
---

The build process produces a Taskcluster release, which takes the form of a [terraform-json.md](Terraform JSON) file.
A release can be deployed anywhere, so the build process does not contain any deployment-specific settings, and in particular, has no rootUrl.
Most installations of Taskcluster will deploy the "upstream" release produced by the Taskcluster team, incorporating deployment-specific configuration such as rootUrl.

# Building Taskcluster

The build process takes a [cluster spec](./cluster-spec) and source code and, along with lots of external resources like docker images, third-party packages, and so on, produces a "release".
The build process uses a *build config* for credentials to access artifact repositories, etc.
The content of the configuration does not affect the result of the build.

The output of the build process is a Taskcluster release, which takes the form of a [terraform-json.md](Terraform JSON) file.

Note that builds are not deterministic.
Two builds of exactly the same source may produce artifacts with different hashes.
In practice, the results are similar enough that this is not an issue.

## Usage

To build a release:

```
./taskcluster-builder build --push --base-dir /tmp/base-dir
```

Omit `--push` to skip pushing to a Docker registry (e.g., for local testing).
For best results, the `--base-dir` option should be on fast, large storage.

The build process attempts to skip steps that need not be performed, so re-running the build process is often quite fast.
The `--no-cache` option will destroy any cached state and start from scratch.
