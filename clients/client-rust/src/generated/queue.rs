    /// We currently support "S3 Artifacts" for data storage.
    ///

    /// stored on S3. When creating an S3 artifact the queue will return a
    /// pre-signed URL to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your
    /// artifact. Note that `PUT` request **must** specify the `content-length`
    /// header and **must** give the `content-type` header the same value as in
    /// the request to `createArtifact`.
    /// 
    /// **Redirect artifacts**, will redirect the caller to URL when fetched
    /// with a a 303 (See Other) response.  Clients will not apply any kind of
    /// authentication to that URL.
    /// 
    /// **Link artifacts**, will be treated as if the caller requested the linked
    /// artifact on the same task.  Links may be chained, but cycles are forbidden.
    /// The caller must have scopes for the linked artifact, or a 403 response will
    /// be returned.
    /// 
    /// **Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
    /// store for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the
    /// worker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you
    /// would otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an
    /// error artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or
    /// turns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will
    /// get a `424` (Failed Dependency) response. This is mainly designed to
