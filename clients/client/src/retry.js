/**
 * Call the given function based on the given retry configuration.  Each call to the
 * function is given a `retriableError` callback.  For retriable failures, call this
 * callback with an Error object (in case retries are exhausted) and return.  For
 * fatal errors, simply throw the error as usual.  The second argument is the attempt number.
 *
 * Note that as per the existing API, `retries` is the number of retries after the first
 * try; that is, a `retries` value of 3 means that `func` will be called 4 times.
