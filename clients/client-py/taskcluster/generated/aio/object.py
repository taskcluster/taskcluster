        Begin upload of a new object

        Create a new object by initiating upload of its data.

        This endpoint implements negotiation of upload methods.  It can be called
        multiple times if necessary, either to propose new upload methods or to
        renew credentials for an already-agreed upload.

        The `uploadId` must be supplied by the caller, and any attempts to upload
        an object with the same name but a different `uploadId` will fail.
        Thus the first call to this method establishes the `uploadId` for the
        object, and as long as that value is kept secret, no other caller can
        upload an object of that name, regardless of scopes.  Object expiration
        cannot be changed after the initial call, either.  It is possible to call
        this method with no proposed upload methods, which hsa the effect of "locking
        in" the `expiration` and `uploadId` properties.

        Unfinished uploads expire after 1 day.

        download methods, and the server will select a method and return the corresponding payload.

        Returns a 406 error if none of the given download methods are available.

        Get an object's data

        Get the data in an object directly.  This method does not return a JSON body, but
        redirects to a location that will serve the object content directly.

        URLs for this endpoint, perhaps with attached authentication (`?bewit=..`),
        are typically used for downloads of objects by simple HTTP clients such as
        web browsers, curl, or wget.

        This method is limited by the common capabilities of HTTP, so it may not be
        the most efficient, resilient, or featureful way to retrieve an artifact.
        Situations where such functionality is required should ues the
        `startDownload` API endpoint.
