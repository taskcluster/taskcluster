        Notification Messages

        An arbitrary message that a taskcluster user
        can trigger if they like.

        The standard one that is published by us watching
        for the completion of tasks is just the task status
        data that we pull from the queue `status()` endpoint
        when we notice a task is complete.

        This exchange takes the following keys:

         * routingKeyKind: Identifier for the routing-key kind. This is always `'primary'` for the formalized routing key. (required)

         * topic: Custom topic. This is the <topic> portion of the `notify.pulse.<topic>.on-<event>` routes. (required)
