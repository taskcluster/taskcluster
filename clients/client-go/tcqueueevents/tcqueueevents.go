// This package was generated from the schema defined at
// /references/queue/v1/exchanges.json
// The queue service is responsible for accepting tasks and track their state
// as they are executed by workers. In order ensure they are eventually
// resolved.
//
// This document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows
// third-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.
// These exchanges targets the following audience:
//   - Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,
//   - Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),
//   - Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.
//
// You'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same
// routing key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages
// about a certain kind tasks.
//
// **Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using
// the `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details
// on permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has
// the entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in
// `task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the
// routing-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.
//
// These routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere
// with the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the
// _primary_ routing key is always prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured
// in the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.
//
// Please, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive
// in your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with
// multiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing
// routing keys.
//
// **Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,
// which means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests
// will ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.
// This is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but
// when re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend
// any related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.
//
// This shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using
// confirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,
// this only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.
//
// **Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the
// server crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the
// future. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us
// if this corner case is of concern to you.

// # How to use this package
//
// This package is designed to sit on top of https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/taskcluster/pulse-go/pulse. Please read
// the pulse package overview to get an understanding of how the pulse client is implemented in go.
//
// This package provides two things in addition to the basic pulse package: structured types for unmarshaling
// pulse message bodies into, and custom Binding interfaces, for defining the fixed strings for task cluster
// exchange names, and routing keys as structured types.
//
// For example, when specifying a binding, rather than using:
//
//	pulse.Bind(
//		"*.*.*.*.*.*.gaia.#",
//		"exchange/taskcluster-queue/v1/task-defined",
//	)
//
// You can rather use:
//
//	queueevents.TaskDefined{WorkerType: "gaia"}
//
// In addition, this means that you will also get objects in your callback method like *queueevents.TaskDefinedMessage
// rather than just interface{}.
