# How it Works

## Tasks

The single most important concept in Taskcluster is the Task.
A task is a single piece of work -- building a binary, running a test suite, or even creating other tasks.
Tasks have logs to show what they have done so far, and create [artifacts](/docs/manual/tasks/artifacts) containing the result of their execution.

Tasks can be linked together by [dependencies](/docs/manual/tasks/dependencies); for example, a test task might depend on the build task that creates the binary to be tested.

## Workers

[Workers](/docs/manual/task-execution/workers) execute tasks.
Workers are organized into [worker pools](/docs/manual/task-execution/worker-pools), collections of identical workers able to execute tasks in paralell.
In many cases, worker pools use cloud services to [dynamically create and destroy workers](/docs/manual/task-execution/provisioning) as demand fluctuates, but Taskcluster also supports static, always-on workers.

## Hooks

While it's possible to create new tasks by [calling the Taskcluster API](/docs/tutorial/apis), Taskcluster can also be configured to create tasks for you.
The [hooks service](/docs/reference/core/hooks) can create tasks based on flexible templates at scheduled times, in response to [pulse](/docs/manual/design/apis/pulse) messages, or in response to other API calls.
For example, scheduled tasks can be used to [periodically refresh generated content](/docs/manual/using/scheduled-tasks).

## Indexes

A Taskcluster deployment can execute millions of tasks per day.
To keep all these tasks straight, the [index service](/docs/reference/core/index) tracks tasks in a flexible, tree-structured way.
In fact, if you want to [find some real tasks](/docs/tutorial/finding-tasks), that's the best place to start.

## And More!

That's just a start!
The [manual](/docs/manual) and [reference](/docs/reference) contain the keys to lots more functionality that isn't mentioned here.
