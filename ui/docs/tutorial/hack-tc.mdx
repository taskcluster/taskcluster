Hacking on Taskcluster is really easy. Head over to the [Taskcluster GitHub
page](https://github.com/taskcluster) and dive right in. Fork a project you
want to contribute to and feel free to make pull requests.

You can find good getting-started bugs at [Codetribute](https://codetribute.mozilla.org/projects/taskcluster).
