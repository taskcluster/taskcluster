This section shows you how to access Taskcluster APIs programmatically.  The
examples use JavaScript and the JavaScript [taskcluster
client](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/clients/client) but apply to [other
supported languages](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries) as well.

## Authenticating to Taskcluster

If you haven't already, try the "[Hello World](/docs/tutoria/hello-world)" tutorial to make
sure that you can sign in to the Taskcluster UI.

Once that's complete, you'll want to get some credentials.  See the advice in [Calling Taskcluster APIs](/docs/manual/using/api), which describes an easy way to do this with `taskcluster signin`.
You will need to set [`TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL`](/docs/tutorial/finding-tc) appropriately to run this command.
In the end, you should have the following three environment variables set:

```bash
export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=..
export TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID=..
export TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=..
```

You can test the results with the `taskcluster` tool, too:

```bash
$ ./taskcluster api auth currentScopes
{
    "scopes": [
        "queue:create-task:proj-getting-started/tutorial"
    ]
}
```
