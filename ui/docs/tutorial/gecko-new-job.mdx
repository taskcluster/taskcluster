# Adding a New Job

Taskcluster runs tasks.
It's just as happy to run your new tasks as any of the already-defined tasks!
All you need to do is add some configuration for your new tasks, then test it out in try.
The documentation for that process is kept [in-tree](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/taskcluster/taskcluster/how-tos.html), where it can co-evolve with the task-graph generation system.

## TreeHerder Reporting

If a tree is built in the forest, and nobody is around to herd it, did it really happen?

If your new job isn't in TreeHerder, it's like it never happened.
Gecko tasks carry a number of fields in `task.extra.treeherder` that describe how the task should be represented in TreeHerder.

## New Worker Type

If your new job requires compute resources that are not already available via Taskcluster, then some additional work may be required.
This will entail defining a new worker type for those compute resources, and then creating those new resources.

For EC2 instances, this is fairly easy: we can specify instance characteristics such as instance type and worker implementation within the AWS provisioner.
Other cloud providers are not currently supported, although doing so is not impossible.
If your tasks need physical hardware, though, then things can be considerably more difficult.
You should begin by discussing your hardware options with the relevant systems operations group.
