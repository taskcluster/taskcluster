# Finding Tasks

The "table of contents" for Taskcluster tasks is the "task index", available on the navigation menu.
When a task completes successfully, it is added to the index at an "index route" given by any `task.routes` entries that begin with `index.`.
(Actually, the Queue just [sends pulse messages to well-known exchanges](/docs/reference/platform/queue/exchanges).
The Index listens to `index.*` for task completion, and indexes the tasks appropriately).

What that means is, you can use the task index to find tasks.
The precise format of the index paths depends on the tasks being run on the Taskcluster deployment you are looking at.
