# Authenticating to Taskcluster

Taskcluster uses its own kind of "credentials" to [authenticate API
requests](/docs/manual/design/apis). These credentials can come from a variety of
sources, but in this section we will create a client manually, using the Tools
site.

If you haven't already, try the "[Hello World](hello-world)" tutorial to make
sure that you can sign in to the tools site.

Open the Clients tool (under Authorization) and create a new client:

 * Add `tutorial` to the end of the clientId
 * Set the expiration date to tomorrow, and check "Automatically delete this client when it expires"
 * Add the scope `queue:create-task:higheste:<workerPoolId>` using the worker pool that you determined in the hello-world step.

When you create the client, the site will give you an accessToken.  Copy that
and set it in your shell session, along with the clientId you chose.  Sometihng
like this:

```bash
export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=https://tc.example.com
export TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID=email/you@yourdomain.com/tutorial
export TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=9dTvVYdzMxAb6qnMPccfQhSzfrMZ1WQ46DgsL_I75S-w
```

The `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` is the rootUrl of your deployment -- the origin in your browser.

## Alternative Process

The [taskcluster-cli](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-cli) project
provides a tool that can do all of the above for you.

<Warning>This technique does not yet work for deployments other than `https://taskcluster.net`.
See [#1619](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/pull/1619) for progress.</Warning>

```
$ eval `taskcluster signin --scope queue:create-task:proj-getting-started/tutorial`
Starting
Listening for a callback on: http://localhost:37885
Opening URL: https://tc.example.com/auth/clients/new?name=cli&description=Temporary+client+for+use+on+the+command+line&scope=*&expires=1d&callback_url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A37885
Credentials output as environment variables
```

You can test the results with the same tool:

```bash
$ ./taskcluster api auth currentScopes
{
    "scopes": [
        "queue:create-task:proj-getting-started/tutorial"
    ]
}
```
