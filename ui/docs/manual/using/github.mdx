# Integrating with Github

Taskcluster provides a convenient integration with Github to enable starting
tasks when events occur on a github repository.  Setting up the integration is
simple: add the integration to the Github organization and repository
(this requires administrator rights on the organization), then add a file called
`.taskcluster.yml` to the root of the repository.

We recommend using the quickstart tool in the Taskcluster UI to get started.
For more in-depth documentation, [the reference
pages](/docs/reference/integrations/github) provide detailed information.

## Task Security

It is convenient for contributors to run tasks on pull requests, but those
tasks then run arbitrary, un-reviewed code. If the tasks have access to
resources that should not be publicly available, then a pull request can
provide a route for a malicious contributor to abuse those resources.

The Github integration provides per-repository configuration for building pull
requests, with the configuration controlled from the default branch (as configured in the GitHub settings for the repository).
The configuration can allow tasks to be created for any author's pull requests,
or limit tasks to pull requests created by repository collaborators.

With a little extra care in setting up the `repo:github.com/<org>/<repo>`
scopes, it is possible to provide scopes for branches (containing trusted,
reviewed code) that differ from the scopes given to pull requests.
