# Namespaces

Names for things in Taskcluster are organized with the least-specific information on the left and the most-specific on the right.
For example, an Index namespace for a release build might look like `mobile-apps.boldr.releases.android.9.v13-7-1`.
Here the left-most component, `mobile-apps`, is the most general, with the app name being more specific.

The use of kleene stars in scopes and roles makes it easy to express powerful concepts using this pattern.
For example, the `boldr` app team can be issued scope `queue:route:mobile-apps.boldr.*`, allowing them to define any index routes with that prefix.
That team might further delegate `queue:route:mobile-apps.boldr.releases.*` only to release builds, so that pull-requests cannot accidentally or maliciously create a release.

A deployment of Taskcluster will typically depend on conventions and carefully designed role configurations to enforce deployment-specific security constraints.
We recommend writing these conventions and configurations down, both in prose and -- for more complex deployments -- in code that enforces them.

What follows are conventions incorporated into the platform itself, and some recommended best practices.

---

## Scopes

Many scopes reflect the namespaces given elsewhere in this document, as described in the API documentation for the service.

* `<service>:<action>:<details>` -
   Scopes for most Taskcluster services follow this pattern.
   For example, the `queue.createTask` call is governed by a scope beginning with `queue:create-task:<details>`, where the details describe a hierarchy of task attributes.
   In cases where an action may be limited along any of several dimensions, each of those dimensions should be a separate scope.

---

## Clients

Client names describe the entity making an API call.
They are used for logging and auditing, but not for access control -- all access control is performed with scopes.
Taskcluster treats the following client IDs specially:

 * `static/*` -
   Clients with names prefixed `static/` are statically configured in the taskcluster deployment.
   They cannot be created, modified or deleted at runtime. These are used for bootstrapping services and creating
   initial clients and roles.

 * `static/taskcluster/*` -
   Clients with the prefix `static/taskcluster/` are reserved for taskcluster services.

 * `<identityProvider>/<identity>` -
   The Taskcluster UI creates client IDs of the form `<identityProvider>/<identity>` when users login.
   For example, a github login might result in a clientId of `github/octocat|1234`.
   Each logged-in user is given permission to manage clients matching `<clientId>/*`.
   Thus `octocat` would be able to create a client named `github/octocat|1234/testing`.
   Such per-user clients are scanned regularly and automatically disabled if their scopes are not satisfied by the user's scopes.

 * `task-client/<taskId>/<runId>/on/<workerGroup>/<workerId>/until/<expiration>` -
   Clients of this form represent specific tasks, and are issued by the queue in the form of temporary credentials.

---

## Roles

Some roles are defined by some kind of automatic usage in a Taskcluster service, as documented in the [reference section](/docs/reference).
Some are defined by convention.
Taskcluster deployments are free to define other roles that do not conflict with the namespaces here.

The taskcluster UI defines the following roles:

* `everybody` -
   This role is granted to anyone who authenticates via the UI.

* `login-identity:<identityProvider>/<identity>`
   This role is granted to the given user only.

* `<groupKind>:<groupName>`
  This role is granted to all users who are members of the given access group, as defined by the login strategy.
  This is the preferred method of granting scopes to users, instead of adding scopes to `login-identity:..` roles, as it means that access will track membership in the external group, even if the specific person's membership changes.
  See the documentation of login strategies in the web-server service for more information.

* `hook-id:<hookGroupId>/<hookId>` -
   Roles of this form give the scopes used to create tasks on behalf of hooks.

* `repo:<host>/<path>:…`,
  `repo:<host>/<path>:branch:<branch>`,
  `repo:<host>/<path>:pull-request`,
  `repo:<host>/<path>:rerun`, -
   Roles of this form represent scopes available to version-control pushes and pull requests.
   The `host` and `path` are modeled on the URL for the repository, allowing the first version of this pattern to apply to all version-control systems.
   The `branch`, `pull-request` and `rerun` forms are specific to version-control systems supporting those concepts.
   This pattern can be extended, too.
   For example, given a system to schedule periodic tasks from a repository, those tasks could be granted `assume:repo:<host>/<path>:cron:<name>`.

* `worker-type:<workerPoolId>`,
  `worker-pool:<workerPoolId>` -
   Roles of this form represent scopes available to workers in the given pool.
   In general, however, workers are given the scopes they require by the worker-manager, and roles of this form are not needed.
   The second form is preferred, with the former maintained for compatibility.

---

## Artifacts

Artifacts are named objects attached to tasks, and available from the queue service.
Artifact names are, by convention, slash-separated.

* `public/…` -
   The queue allows access to any artifact that begins with `public/` without any kind of authentication.
   Public names are not further namespaced: tasks can create any public artifacts they like.
   As such, users should not assume that an artifact with this prefix was created by a known process.
   In other words, any task can create an artifact named `public/build/firefox.exe` , so do not trust such a file without verifying the trustworthiness of the task.

* `private/…` -
   Artifact names with this prefix are considered non-public, but access to them is otherwise quite broadly allowed (e.g., to all Mozilla employees, contractors and community members under NDA).
   In general, users with narrower requirements than "not public" should select a different prefix and add it to this document.

* `private/docker-worker/…`,
  `private/interactive/…` -
   Artifact names with these prefixes are considered non-public, but required for access to the interactive features of the named workers.
* `login-identity/<identity>/…`
   Artifact names with this prefix are conventionally the responsibility of the user with the given [login identity](/docs/reference/core/login).
   This namespace enables tasks to persist data that is only readable by a single user (typically the user that submitted it), such as loaner credentials.
   Access to such artifacts is not automatically granted, but such a grant could be accomplished by adding scope `queue:get-artifact:login-identity/<..>` to role `login-identity:*`.

<Warning>
Highly confidential data should not be stored in unencrypted taskcluster
artifacts, since they are only protected by a single (fallible) system. If
highly sensitive data needs to be persisted, it is recommended to encrypt data
using the public key of a key-pair whose private key has been highly secured,
in order that at least two independent systems protect the data.
</Warning>

---

## Hooks

Hooks are named using the two-part identifier `<hookGroupId>/<hookId>`.
While the Taskcluster platform assigns no particular meaning to these identifiers, the user interface does allow expanding each hook group independently.
A best practice is to include any set of similar, auto-generated hooks, such as hooks for specific repositories, under a single `hookGroupId`.

---

## Worker Pools and Task Queues

The `workerPoolId` and `taskQueueId` namespaces are closely linked: workers in worker pool `workerPoolId` will claim task from queue `taskQueueId` with `taskQueueId = workerPoolId`.

Scopes of the form `queue:create-task:<workerPoolId>` are the primary means of controlling access to workers, so deployments should carefully consider the order of components in the names.
For example, if release workers are segregated from CI workers as a security boundary, then access to `queue:create-task:relase-*` might be more strictly controlled than access to `queue:create-task:ci-*`.

---

## Worker IDs

Workers are identified by the two-level name `<workerGroup>/<workerId>`.
Worker-Manager providers are responsible for defining these identifiers.
Typically the `workerId` is taken from the underlying cloud provider, and `workerGroup` is chosen to correspond to the uniqueness boundary provided by that cloud provider.
For example, in AWS EC2, the region is used as the `workerGroup`.

---

## Scheduler IDs

Scheduler IDs are limited to 22 characters.
We do not subdivide namespaces; instead, they are enumerated here:

 * `tc-diagnostics` -- the Taskcluster diagnostics tool
 * `taskcluster-github` -- the Taskcluster Github integration

---

## Worker Caches

For workers that share the same worker pool, a secondary security boundary can be provided by cache names, preventing tasks in one security context from accessing (and potentially poisoning) caches in another security boundary.
For example, caches for CI tasks might match `ci-*`, while caches for releases match `release-*`.
Then, even if release and CI tasks share the same workers, the two classes of tasks will not share caches.

---

## Secrets

Secrets provide key-value storage governed by scopes.
As such, it's very important that secrets not be unexpectedly made accessible to users who should not see them.

A best practice for secrets is to deeply namespace them with clear names, and restrict user access as much as possible.
This avoids the risk that an overly-helpful administrator will accidentally grant access to some critical data.

Additionally, it is a best practice for secret-related scopes in `task.scopes` to specify secrets individually, rather than use `*` notation.
This ensures that a new secret is not unintentionally readable by existing tasks.

The worker-manager defines the following secrets:

* `worker-type:<workerPoolId>`,
  `worker-pool:<workerPoolId>` -
  Workers are given scopes to read these secrets at startup, allowing them to be configured with secret values.
  The format of such secrets is `{"config": .., "files": ..}`.
  See [worker-runner](/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner) for more on how this is interpreted.
  The second form is preferred, but scopes are provided for both forms.

The following convention is recommended for repository-specific secrets:

* Names like `repo:<host>/<path>:..`, matching the format of simiarly named roles, are used for secrets available to tasks for the given repository.
  Since `*` does not expand in a secret name, absolute names such as `repo:<host>/<path>` are used for shared secrets.

---

## Indexes

The index provides a nice, dot-separated hierarchy of names. When using these as AMQP routes, they are prefixed with `index.`, so for example the project 'foo' might route messages about its level 3 repository tasks to routes starting with `index.project.foo.level-3.…`

---

## Projects

For Taskcluster deployments which support a variety of related projects, Taskcluster recommends establishing "project" namespaces.
These provide a nice organizational boundary, isolating unrelated projects while still allowing resource-sharing where desired.
Select a short, consistent name for each project, without punctuation.

The "owners" of each project are granted `project-admin:<project>`, typically via one of the group-related routes described above.
The `project-admin:*` parameterized role then grants the following scopes:

 * `assume:hook-id:project-<..>/*`
 * `assume:project:<..>:*`
 * `assume:worker-type:proj-<..>/*`
 * `auth:create-client:project/<..>/*`
 * `auth:create-role:hook-id:project-<..>/*`
 * `auth:create-role:project:<..>:*`
 * `auth:delete-client:project/<..>/*`
 * `auth:delete-role:hook-id:project-<..>/*`
 * `auth:delete-role:project:<..>:*`
 * `auth:disable-client:project/<..>/*`
 * `auth:enable-client:project/<..>/*`
 * `auth:reset-access-token:project/<..>/*`
 * `auth:update-client:project/<..>/*`
 * `auth:update-role:hook-id:project-<..>/*`
 * `auth:update-role:project:<..>:*`
 * `hooks:modify-hook:project-<..>/*`
 * `hooks:trigger-hook:project-<..>/*`
 * `index:insert-task:project.<..>.*`
 * `project:<..>:*`
 * `queue:claim-work:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:highest:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:high:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:lowest:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:low:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:medium:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:very-high:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:create-task:very-low:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:get-artifact:project/<..>/*`
 * `queue:quarantine-worker:proj-<..>/*`
 * `queue:route:index.project.<..>.*`
 * `queue:worker-id:proj-<..>/*`
 * `secrets:get:project/<..>/*`
 * `secrets:set:project/<..>/*`

Project admins may then delegate portions of these scopes as desired.
The scopes cover:

* scopes `project:<project>:…`
* clients `project/<project>/*`
* roles `project:<project>:*`
* artifacts `project/<project/*`
* hooks `project-<project>/*`
* worker pools `project-<project>/*`
* secrets `project/<project>/*`
* index namespaces `project.<project>.*`

<Warning>
In some cases, projects need additional scopes.
To do so, create a role `project:&lt;project>:grants/&lt;grantName>` containing the desired scopes.
This role can then be assumed where necessary, or project admins can use it to grant specific scopes as desired.
</Warning>
