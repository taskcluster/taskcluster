Since task IDs are random, it can be difficult to find a task after it has been
created without recording that task ID somewhere. The Github integration will
link to tasks from pull requests and commits, and services like Treeherder
gather and link to tasks for specific projects, but neither of these solutions
is especially flexible.

The [Index service](/docs/reference/core/index) stores references to completed tasks
in a hierarchical naming structure, similar to a directory tree. Careful naming
allows a more flexible approach. For example, if one of the hierarchy levels is
the revision ID from version control, then it is simple to find a task given a
revision ID.
