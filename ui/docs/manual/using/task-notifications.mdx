There are two ways to have Taskcluster send notifications on your behalf.

The first is by specifying certain routes in the task definition, for example:

```yaml
routes:
 - notify.email.example@example.com.on-failed
```

This method is described in detail on the Taskcluster-Notify [usage
page](/docs/reference/core/notify/usage).

The second method is to call the Taskcluster-Notify service directly.  The API
definitions are available on the [reference
page](/docs/reference/core/notify/api). The API is available
through the
[Taskcluster-Proxy](/docs/reference/workers/docker-worker/docs/features#feature-taskclusterproxy-)
if you're working from within a task.

```js
import taskcluster from 'taskcluster-client';
async function notify() {
    # specify a baseUrl via the taskcluster proxy
    var notify = new taskcluster.Notify({baseUrl: 'http://taskcluster/notify/v1'});
    await notify.irc({'#myproject', 'example', 'the build is still running'})
}
```
