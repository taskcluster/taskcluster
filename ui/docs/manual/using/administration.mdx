# Deployment Administration

A small, simple application might be deployed into a cloud service such as AWS or GCP via the cloud service's web interface, clicking a few buttons to create and configure the appropriate resources.
But this approach does not scale very far -- once more applications are involved or the applications become more complex, it's too easy to miss settings, conflict with other administrators, or lose track of what has changed.
Tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/) are designed to automate configuration of such cloud deployments.

By analogy, a small, single-purpose Taskcluster deployment might be managed by hand using the Taskcluster UI.
But once that deployment becomes more complex, automation becomes important.

## Version-Controlled Configuration

The recommended approach borrows from devops: store configuration in a version-control repository and manage changes using normal code-review processes.
The format of this configuration varies depending on the nature of the deployment.

This configuration is coupled with a tool that can "apply" it to a Taskcluster deployment by calling Taskcluster API methods to create, update, or delete resources as necessary.

## tc-admin

The Taskcluster team provides [tc-admin](https://github.com/taskcluster/tc-admin), a Python library which supports this kind of administration.
With the creation of a few files to define the desired resources, this library makes management as easy as

```
$ tc-admin diff
```

to see what resources need to be updated, and

```
$ tc-admin apply
```

to apply the given changes.

See [the repository](https://github.com/taskcluster/tc-admin) for more information.
