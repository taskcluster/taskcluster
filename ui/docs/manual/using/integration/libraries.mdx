Taskcluster includes client libraries suitable for calling Taskcluster APIs.
These handle URL generation, request and response bodies, authentication, and retries on error.

Client libraries are available in a number of languages, and are co-versioned with Taskcluster itself.
That is, a client with version x.y.z contains API methods corresponding to Taskcluster version x.y.z.

The client libraries are:

* Server-Side JavaScript - https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/taskcluster-client
* Browser-Side JavaScript - https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/taskcluster-client-web
* Python - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/taskcluster
* Go - https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-client-go
