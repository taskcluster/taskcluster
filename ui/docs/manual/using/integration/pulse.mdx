[Pulse](/docs/manual/design/apis/pulse) provides a great arms-length integration
point for connecting other services to Taskcluster. Taskcluster already sends a
great many messages as tasks are executed, and the `task.routes` property
allows you to add additional, custom messages.

A common pattern -- used by Treeherder, for example -- is to include a custom
route in tasks of interest, then add additional configuration under the
`task.extra` key.

For example a custom build dashboard for the amazingcats project might add the
route `project.amazingcats.<revision>.test` to each test task. The dashboard
would listen for messages copied to this route.  For each task, it would
examine `task.extra.amazingcats.test-info` to find information about the tests
that were run, and might also look for a test-specific artifact in the task
indicating the results of those tests. All of this gets loaded into the
dashboard's database and displayed to developers.

At the moment, Taskcluster does not react to external pulse messages, but there
are [plans](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/issues/66) to add
such support.
