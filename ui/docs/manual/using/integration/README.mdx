Taskcluster is built to mix in with other applications in a larger CI
environment. Aside from the platform services, no Taskcluster component is
privileged and other implementations are always possible.

For example, the Taskcluster UI site is built to be generally useful and to
provide a clear view of the Taskcluster system, but may not be suited to
providing the information your developers need. It's easy to write a new
frontend that uses the Taskcluster services to generate a dashboard specific to
your project, and even to authenticate users and allow them to manipulate tasks
and other APIs via your site.

Backend applications can create tasks and call other Taskcluster API methods.
They can also listen for Taskcluster-related events via Pulse and react
appropriately, perhaps recording test performance statistics into a database
for later analysis.
