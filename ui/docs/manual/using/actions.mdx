title: Defining User Actions on Existing Tasks
---

[Actions](/docs/manual/conventions/actions) allow users to affect a task or task-graph after it has been submitted.
Common actions are:

-   Retrigger a task,
-   Retry specific test cases many times,
-   Obtain a loaner machine,
-   Backfill missing tasks,

Actions are defined in-tree, so they are specific to the software being built and can be modified through the usual review process.
Taskcluster defines a [convention](/docs/manual/conventions/actions) which allows user interfaces to connect users to these actions.

See [Implementation Guidelines](/docs/manual/design/conventions/actions/guidelines) for more information on defining actions.
