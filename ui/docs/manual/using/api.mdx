# Calling Taskcluster APIs

Probably the most common way to integrate with Taskcluster is to call its API methods.
The technical details of how these calls occur are documented in [Microservice APIs](/docs/manual/design/apis), and the individual API methods are in the [Reference](/docs/reference) section.
You will need the [root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls) for the deployment you want to access.

It's possible to call Taskcluster APIs with any HTTP client, but there are easier ways!

## Client Libraries

Taskcluster includes client libraries suitable for calling Taskcluster APIs.
These handle URL generation, request and response bodies, authentication, and retries on error.

Client libraries are available in a number of languages, and are co-versioned with Taskcluster itself.
That is, a client with version x.y.z contains API methods corresponding to Taskcluster version x.y.z.
Taskcluster is careful to maintain API compatibility, and guarantees it within a major version.
That means that any client with major version x will work against any Taskcluster services with major version x, and is very likely to work for many other major versions of the Taskcluster services.
Any incompatibilities are noted in the [Changelog](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

Each client library behaves a little differently, conforming to the customs of its language.

The client libraries are:

* Server-Side JavaScript - https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/taskcluster-client
* Browser-Side JavaScript - https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/taskcluster-client-web
* Python (Python 2 and 3, sync and async) - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/taskcluster
* Go - https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/clients/client-go
* Shell - https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/clients/client-shell

## Authentication

In general, tools that integrate with Taskcluster should accept Taskcluster credentials as [environment variables](/docs/manual/design/env-vars).

When running outside of a task, these will generally be provided in `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL`, `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, and `TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` (and sometimes `TASKCLUSTER_CERTIFICATE`.
All of the clients provide functionality that makes this easy:

 * JavaScript: `queue = new taskcluster.Queue(taskcluster.fromEnvVars());`
 * Python: `queue = taskcluster.Queue(taskcluster.optionsFromEnvironment())`
 * Go: `myQueue := tcqueue.NewFromEnv()`
 * Shell: (env vars are read automatically)

### Getting Credentials on the Command Line

The [shell client](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/clients/client-shell) provides an easy way to set the necessary environment variables.
Begin by setting the `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` to the root URL for the deployment you are using.

<SiteSpecific>
For this deployment, that means:
```shell
export TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=%root_url%
```
</SiteSpecific>

```shell
$ eval `taskcluster signin`
```

You might make this easy to use with a shell function in ~/.bashrc:

```shell
tc-signin() { eval `taskcluster signin "${@}"`; }
```

This will open a web browser to get credentials, then set the corresponding environment variables in your shell session.

It's common to pass a `--name` (to help you differentiate clients from one another) and one or more `--scope` arguments:

```shell
tc-signin --name smoketest --scope assume:project:taskcluster:smoketests
```

### Using Clients in a Task

Code running in a properly-configured task can use the scopes afforded to that task directly, avoiding handling any Taskcluster credentials directly.
This functionality is implemented by [taskcluster-proxy](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy), which is integrated into both docker-worker and generic-worker.

To activate it, include `taskclusterProxy: true` in the task payload's `features` property:

```yaml
payload:
  features:
    taskclusterProxy: true
  # ...
```

Within the task, the worker will set the environment variable `TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL` to a URL which will proxy requests to the services after adding credentials corresponding to the running task's scopes.
The clients generally require explicit configuration for this arrangement:

 * JavaScript: `queue = new taskcluster.Queue({rootUrl: process.env.TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL});`
 * Python: `queue = taskcluster.Queue({"rootUrl": os.environ["TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL"]})`
 * Go: `myQueue := tcqueue.NewFromEnv()` (automatically uses the proxy)
 * Shell: `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL=$TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL taskcluster api ...`

In many cases, it's not necessary to use a client library for simple operations within a task, as any HTTP client will do.
For example, [s3-uploads](/docs/manual/using/s3-uploads) uses `curl` and `jq` from a shell script to fetch a secret value.
