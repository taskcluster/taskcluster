Taskcluster is a very open platform, so a secret embedded in a task definition
or a task artifact is not very secret.

Ideally, tasks would not need access to any secrets, since most tasks run
source code from a version-control repository -- even un-trusted code in the
case of a Github pull request. It's all too easy to accidentally or maliciously
output a secret to the task logs, and such a disclosure is unlikely to be
noticed quickly.

The [Secrets service](/docs/reference/core/secrets) provides a simple way to store
JSON-formatted secrets in a secure fashion. Access to secrets can be controlled
by [scopes](/docs/manual/design/apis/hawk/scopes).

The most common approach is to use the Taskcluster UI to create secrets named
according to the [namespaces document](/docs/manual/using/namespaces), then read
those secrets in tasks via the taskcluster proxy. Access to the secrets is
granted by adding a scope to the repository's role.

For example, generating a documentation site might require access upload the resulting site [to s3](s3-uploads), which requires AWS credentials.
The task definition in `.taskcluster.yml` has a scope to read this secret and
enables the docker-worker taskclusterProxy feature:

```yaml
scopes:
scopes:
  - "secrets:get:repo:github.com/softwarez/myapp"
payload:
  features:
    taskclusterProxy: true
# ..
```

The role for the master branch of the repository,
`github.com/softwarez/myapp:branch:master`, contains the same scope
`secrets:get:repo:github.com/softwarez/myapp`

Note that the `..:pull-request` role does *not* have this scope, so pull
requests cannot upload documentation.

See [s3-uploads](s3-uploads) for more detail on this approach.
