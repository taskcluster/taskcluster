# Object Service

The object service uses "backends" to manage storage of data in cloud providers.
Each is identified by a `backendId`.
When an object is created (uploaded), it is assigned a backend.

## Cautions

Be careful to never remove a backend which still has objects, as those objects will become inaccessible and may not be deleted.

Be careful, too, not to change a backend configuration in such a way that the existing objects will become inaccessible.
For example, do not change the cloud account or bucket for a cloud backend.
Instead, create a new backend for the new account and create new objects in that backend, allowing the old objects to expire.

## Backend Configuration

Backends are configured in the `object.backend` configuration value, which is a JSON object mapping `{ backendId: config }`.
The `config` must contain a `backendType` property giving the type of this backend; the remaining configuration is specific to the backend type, documented below.
It's perfectly fine to have multiple backends with the same type; for example, two backends with different accounts in the same cloud.

For example:

```yaml
backends:
  general-purpose:
    backendType: aws
    # ...
  proj-fuzzing:
    backendType: aws
    # ...
```

See the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/platform/object/) for descriptions of the available backends and their configuration.

The backend for a specific object is determined when that object is uploaded, based on the `object.backend_map` configuration value.
This is a JSON array containing a sequence of match expressions.
The first matching expression determines the backend to use; remaining expressions are not considered.

Each match expression has the form `{ backendId: .., when: .. }`, giving the `backendId` to use when the condition is true.
The `when` property gives patterns for the object's `name` and `projectId`, all of which must match.
The pattern can be an exact match, given as `{is: '<value>'}` or just `'<value>'`
It can also be a regular expression, given as `{regexp: '<exp>'}`.
The regular expression is not automatically anchored to the beginning and end of the object name, so it is common to use `^`, e.g., `when: {name: {regexp: '^public/'}}`.
As a special case, `when: 'all'` matches all objects, and is typically used as a catch-all in the last array element.

Putting all of that together:

```yaml
backend_map:
  # project jitterbug gets its own backend
  - backendId: proj-jitterbug
    when:
      projectId: jitterbug

  # project lindy's builds are stored in a dedicated backend
  - backendId: proj-lindy
    when:
      name: {regexp: '^builds/'}
      projectId: {is: 'lindy'}

  # logs are stored in a special reduced-redundancy backend
  - backendId: reduced-redundancy
    when:
      name: {regexp: '^public/logs/'}

  # catch-all
  - backendId: general-purpose
    when: all
```

## Backend Types

### AWS (for AWS _and_ Google!)

The `aws` backend type stores objects using the AWS S3 protocol.

Since Google Cloud provides an S3-interoperability API, this means the AWS
Backend can _also_ be used to persist objects in Google Cloud Storage.

Objects are stored in the bucket using their full name.

Each backend has the following configuration parameters:
 * `bucket`
 * `accessKeyId`
 * `secretAccessKey`
 * `signGetUrls` (optional, default false)
 * `endpoint` (optional, default null)

 For example:

```yaml
backends:
  publicStuff:
    backendType: "aws"
    accessKeyId: "<gcp hmac access key ID>"
    secretAccessKey: "<gcp hmac secret access key>"
    bucket: "my-objects"
    signGetUrls: false
    endpoint: "https://storage.googleapis.com" # (for Google)
```

#### AWS Configuration

The bucket parameter names the bucket in which to store the objects.
You must pre-create the bucket in the appropriate region.
The credentials should correspond to an IAM user with the following policy, with `$BUCKET` replaced with the bucket name:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1462988481000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketCORS",
                "s3:PutBucketCORS",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET",
                "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Google Cloud Configuration

To use Google Cloud Storage, set `endpoint` to `https://storage.googleapis.com`
and follow the [Simple Migration
Guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/migrating#migration-simple) to set
up appropriate HMAC key and configure your Google Cloud project appropriately.

The provided credentials should correspond to a service account that has no directly-assigned roles.
Set the bucket permissions to "uniform" mode and grant "Storage Legacy Bucket Owner" and "Storage Legacy Object Owner" to the service account.
Note that there is no need to set a default project.

#### Signing GET URLs

The `signGetUrls` config controls the form of the URLs used for simple downloads (such as for loading artifacts in a browser).

In cases where the data is public anyway, signed URL signatures can cause unnecessary friction as they are long and expire quickly.
Setting `signGetUrls` to false in this case causes the backend to generate un-signed URLs, which are short and easy for users to pass around.

In general, if the bucket contents are public, set this to `false` as signatures are unnecessary; otherwise, set it to true.

## Middleware

The object service supports "middleware" that can intercept download requests.
This is configured with the `object.middleware` configuration value.
This is a JSON array containing a sequence of middleware specifications, which will be tried in order.
Each is a JSON object that must have at least a `middlewareType` giving the type of middleware; the remaining properties are specific to that middleware type.

## Middleware Types

### CDN

The `cdn` middleware supports redirecting simple download requests to fetch instead from a CDN.
Its configuration has `middlewareType` `"cdn"` and

 * `regexp` - a regular expression over object names, matching objects that should be redirected
 * `baseUrl` the base URL to which the object name should be suffixed to generate the CDN URL.

For example:

```yaml
middleware:
  - { middlewareType: "cdn", regexp: "^public/.*", baseUrl: "https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/" }
```

This configuration would redirect all objects beginning with `public/` to be served at URLs like `https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/public/some/object`.
