# Workers

The worker-manager service uses "providers" to handle workers in various clouds (or, in no cloud at all).
Each is identified by a `providerId`, referenced from the worker pool definitions defined in the Taskcluster API.

## Cautions

Be careful to never remove a provider which still has worker pools.
Note that worker pools persist for some time after they are "deleted", until all workers are stopped and a periodic task finally reaps the worker pool.

Be careful, too, not to change a provider configuration in such a way that the worker manager's internal state will be invalidated.
For example, do not change the cloud accout for a provider.
Instead, create a new provider for the new account and migrate worker pools to that new provider.

## Provider Configuration

Providers are configured in the services `PROVIDERS` config, which is structured as a JSON object mapping `providerId` to the configuration for that provider.
Each configuration object has at least a `providerType` property, defining the type of cloud in which workers should be provisioned.

### Static

A provider with `providerType = "static"` manages workers that are not dynamically created in response to demand.
It is typically used for workers in datacenters, but can also be used for cloud instances that are created through some non-Taskcluster mechanism.

A static provider is be configured in `providers` with the following structure.
Since there is usually no reason to have multiple static providers, the provider is typically named "static".

```json
{
  "static": {
    "providerType": "static"
  },
  ...
}
```


### Google

A google-based provider is configured in `providers` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "myProvider": {
    "providerType": "google",
    "project": "<gcp project identifier>",
    "workerServiceAccountId": "<uniqueId of a service account in this project that workers will use>",
    "apiRateLimits": {
      "get": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 20000},
      "query": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 40000},
      "list": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 20000},
      "opRead": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 20000}
    },
    "creds": "<google credentials>"
  },
  ...
}
```

#### GCP Project

The `project` configuration names the project in which instances will be created.
It is the project *ID* and not the human-readable project name.

The project will need the following APIs enabled:

* Compute Engine API
* Identity and Access Management (IAM) API

#### API Rate Limit Overrides

By default worker-manager will limit its interactions with a GCP project to the
[documented api rate limits](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/api-rate-limits). You
can optionally override this for the categories `get`, `query`, `list`, and `opRead` which
cover the entirety of calls that worker-manager makes. This could be useful if you get
your limits raised by google.

#### Service Accounts

The provider requires *two* service accounts in the designated project.

The first, typically named `taskcluster-workers`, is the service account that worker-manager will assign to workers
it starts. Give this service account whatever google permissions you wish your
workers to have. This could be something like writing to stackdriver for example.
You provide the numeric `uniqueId` of this service account in the `workerServiceAccountId` field.

<Warning>
It is important to know that tasks will also have access to this service-account if they try hard enough so make sure you keep that in mind while giving permissions to the `taskcluster-workers` service account.
</Warning>

<Warning>
In its infinite wisdom, Google has made the `uniqueId` field of service accounts un-selectable in the UI, and thus impossible to copy.
Rather than typing this number yourself, or firing up an OCR tool, right-click to "inspect" the element, remove the "disabled" property, and then copy from the element.
</Warning>

The second service account, typically named `taskcluster-worker-manager`, is for worker-manager itself and is used to create workers.
It should have the following roles:

* `roles/compute.admin` ("Compute Admin")
* `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` ("Service Account User")

The GCP key for this service account must be provided in `creds`.
This key is the large JSON object containing a service account's keys, and looks something like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "my-project-id-1234",
  "private_key_id": "abc123",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nabc123\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "thisthing@something.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "1234",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/thisthing%40something.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```
This will need to be included either as a string, base64'd string, or just json/yaml in the `creds` property.

### AWS

An AWS-based provider is configured in `providers` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "myProvider": {
    "providerType": "aws",
    "credentials": {
      "accessKeyId": "...",
      "secretAccessKey": "..."
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

The credentials must correspond to an IAM user with the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "WorkerManager",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The account should have its [AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot service-linked role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#service-linked-roles-spot-instance-requests) set up.
Follow the "To manually create.." process at that link.
You can verify that this worked by creating a spot request manually in the console.
If this service-linked role is not set up properly, worker creation will fail with the message "The provided credentials do not have permission to create the service-linked role for EC2 Spot Instances".

We recommend a dedicated AWS account for workers, but understand that this is difficult to set up for small deployments.
If the AWS account is shared with other uses, it is possible to make a more restrictive policy limiting, for example, the security groups or subnets in which the provider can create instances.

### Azure

An Azure-based provider is configured in `providers` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "myProvider": {
    "providerType": "azure",
    "clientId": "your-azure-client-id",
    "secret": "azure-secret",
    "domain": "creds-domain",
    "subscriptionId": "your-subscription-id",
    "resourceGroupName": "azure-provider-resource-group",
    "apiRateLimits": {
      "get": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 20000},
      "query": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 40000},
      "list": {"interval": 1000, "intervalCap": 20000}
    }
  }
}
```

Create a new resource group, in which all resources will be created (note that the location of the resource group is not related to the location of the workers).

Create a new "App Registration" as well, but do not create secrets for it yet.
It must first be granted appropriate permissions.
See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) for information on creating Azure AD Applications, assigning roles, and getting credentials.

Azure-based providers need permissions to manage virtual machines, network interfaces, disks, and public IP addresses.
The following is an example custom Azure role definition that encompasses the scope of permissions an Azure-based provider needs.
Add this under your subscription -> "IAM" -> "Create a Custom Role", and start from JSON using content like this:

```json
{
  "Name": "Worker-Manager Azure Provider",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Based on Virtual Machine Contributor + image access, delete access",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.Authorization/*/read",
    "Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/*",
    "Microsoft.Compute/locations/*",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/*",
    "Microsoft.Compute/disks/*",
    "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/*",
    "Microsoft.Compute/images/read",
    "Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*",
    "Microsoft.Network/locations/*",
    "Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/*",
    "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/join/action",
    "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/join/action",
    "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/delete",
    "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write",
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read",
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action",
    "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*",
    "Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read",
    "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action",
    "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read",
    "Microsoft.Support/*"
  ],
  "AssignableScopes": [
    "/subscriptions/your-subscription-id"
  ]
}
```

Again under your subscription -> "IAM", choose "Add" -> "Add role assignment" and assign the new role to the Enterprise App created earlier.
The app will be listed under "User, group, or service principal".

Back in the App Registration, select "Certificates & Secrets" and create a new client secret.
Note that the credentials cannot be configured to not expire.
We recommend choosing the maximum expiration, and scheduling a reminder before that expiration date, as Azure will provide no notice of credential expiration.

Note that the ID of the client secret is not used.

Now set the following configuration:

* `subscriptionId` - the Subscription containing this App Registration
* `clientId` - the "Application (client) ID"
* `domain` - the "Directory (tenant) ID"
* `secret` the generated secret
* `resourceGroupName` - the name of the resource group
* `apiRateLimits` - optional limits on the rate at which worker-manager calls Azure APIs

### Launch configurations

Worker pools that target the Azure provider define one or more `launchConfigs`. Each launch configuration can use one of two provisioning strategies:

- **Sequential resource provisioning**: omit `armDeployment` and supply VM-centric properties (`location`, `subnetId`, `storageProfile`, `networkProfile`, etc.). Worker-manager creates and tears down the VM, NIC, IP, and disks one at a time.
- **ARM template provisioning**: include an `armDeployment` object (and optionally `armDeploymentResourceGroup`). Worker-manager submits the template to Azure Resource Manager, automatically supplying required parameters (`adminUsername`, `adminPassword`, `computerName`, `customData`, `vmName`). When the deployment finishes, worker-manager records the resources it created and deletes the deployment so deprovisioning still works as expected.

Example launch configuration that uses a template spec:

```json
"launchConfigs": [
  {
    "workerManager": {
      "launchConfigId": "lc-arm-example",
      "capacityPerInstance": 1
    },
    "workerConfig": {
      "genericWorker": {
        "config": {
          "shutdownMachineOnIdle": true
        }
      }
    },
    "armDeployment": {
      "mode": "Incremental",
      "templateLink": {
        "id": "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Resources/templateSpecs/<spec>/versions/1.0.0"
      },
      "parameters": {
        "location": { "value": "eastus" },
        "vmSize": { "value": "Standard_D4s_v5" },
        "subnetId": {
          "value": "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<network-rg>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet>/subnets/default"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Resource Groups

Resources in Azure are created within the context of resource groups. The provider is configured with the `resourceGroupName` in which resources will be created.
This allows for a convenient grouping of all provider-related resources. Unrelated resources can exist within the resource group, but this is not recommended.

### Resource Dependencies

Azure-based providers create and manage worker resources, but also expect resources to already exist within the subscription and resource group that the provider is configured for.

#### Expected resources:

- a Resource Group
- one or more Virtual Networks
- one or more Subnets within Virtual Networks
- an Azure storage account (in which disks will be created)

#### Recommended:

- one or more Network Security Groups to associate with Virtual Machines

### Rate Limiting / Retries

The Azure SDK has built-in support for handling rate limiting for most client uses, so requests should be retried appropriately.
The provider has its own retry functionality which can be configured as well.

See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-throttling-errors) for more information on Azure throttling.

### Spot Instances

Azure spot instances are configured using a combination of settings: `billingProfile` and `priority`.
Spot instances should have `priority` set to `Spot`, and a `billingProfile` with a `maxPrice` value corresponding to an amount in dollars.

See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/createorupdate#billingprofile) for more information on `billingProfile` and `maxPrice`.
