# Smoketests

Taskcluster ships with a set of "smoketests" that can be used to check for major issues in a deployment.

## Setup

To run the smoketests, you will need a client with sufficient scopes.
We recommend adding these scopes to a role named `project:taskcluster:smoketests` and creating a client with scope `assume:project:taskcluster:smoketests`.
Set the [environment variables](/docs/manual/design/env-vars) `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL`, `TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`.

The required scopes may vary from version to version.
To see the required scopes, begin with a role containing no scopes and run the smoketests as described below.
The error message will describe the missing scopes.

## Running Smoketests

From a checkout of the Taskcluster source, where `yarn install` has already been run, run the smoketests as follows:

```
$ yarn smoketest
yarn run v1.19.1
$ node infrastructure/tooling/src/main.js smoketest
✔ Ping health endpoint for web-server
✔ Ping health endpoint for auth
ℹ Ping health endpoint for built-in-workers (No exposed web service)
✔ Ping health endpoint for github
...
```

Alternately, the `taskcluster/taskcluster-devel` docker image can be used:

```
$ docker run -ti --rm \
  -e TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL -e TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN -e TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID \
  taskcluster/taskcluster-devel:v1.2.3 script/smoketest
yarn run v1.19.1
$ node infrastructure/tooling/src/main.js smoketest
✔ Ping health endpoint for web-server
...
```

Substitute the deployed Taskcluster version for `v1.2.3`.
Note that this docker image is quite large!
