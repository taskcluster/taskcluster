# GitHub Integration

The GitHub service requires a GitHub App in order to interact with GitHub.

## App Setup

To create such an app, use the docs at https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/.

* Ownership: if possible, create the application under a relevant GitHub organization.  Apps can be transferred after creation, though, so this is not critical.
* Name: not critical, but we recommend "&lt;deployment-name>-taskcluster".
* Homepage URL should link to your deployment's [root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls)
* Setup URL should link to your taskcluster instance's quickstart guide, `/quickstart` on your deployment's root URL
* Webhook URL should link to `/api/github/v1/github` on your deployment's root URL
* Set the secret to an arbitrary value that you also configure in your Taskcluster instance's settings.
* Under `Repository permissions` set:
  * Administration: Read-only
  * Checks: Read and write
  * Commit statuses: Read and write
  * Contents: Read-only
  * Issues: Read and write
  * Metadata: Read-only
  * Pull requests: Read and write
  * Leave everything else set to `No access`
* Under `Organization permissions` set:
  * Members: Read-only
  * Leave everything else set to `No access`
* Under `Subscribe to events` check the following boxes:
  * Pull request
  * Push
  * Release

## Taskcluster Configuration

In the Helm templates, you'll need to set

* `github.bot_username` -- this should match the name in the integration's URL.  For example, if the URL is https://github.com/apps/acme-taskcluster then the `bot_name` should be `acme-taskcluster`.
* `github.github_app_id` -- numeric app_id, visible in the app settings
* `github.webhook_secret` -- the webhook secret for the application.  Set this to the same random string here and in the GitHub UI.  In most cases, this is a single value, but multiple values can be specified separated by space characters, to allow for smooth rotation of the secret.
* `github.github_private_pem` -- see below

On the app's settings page, generate a private key, and add its PEM to your Taskcluster instance's configs.
This is a multiline string.
If your deployment mechanics do not handle multiline values correctly, the newlines can be replaced by a literal `\n` escape sequence, thus fitting on a single (long) line.
Note that the entire PEM key, including the "BEGIN" and "END" lines, must be included, with no additional whitespace or other formatting added or moved.
