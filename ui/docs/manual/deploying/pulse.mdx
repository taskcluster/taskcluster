title: Pulse
---

Taskcluster uses RabbitMQ to communicate between microservices.
The particular approach it takes to this communication is called "Pulse", taken from a larger project at Mozilla, but it can run against any RabbitMQ deployment, either local or hosted by a commercial provider.

Most services will require service-specific credentials for access to Pulse.
