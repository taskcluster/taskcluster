# Queue Configuration

This section describes configuration values specific to the Queue service.

## Artifact Storage

### Object Service

The preferred approach for artifact storage is to use the object service.
For this purpose, the queue requires no configuration.

Artifact data will be stored in objects named `t/<taskId>/<runId>/<name>`.
This naming pattern can be leveraged to store some artifacts differently from others.
See the [object service](object-service) section for more detail.

### S3 Artifacts

Until everything uses the Object Service, the queue service must be configured to support S3 artifacts.
That involves the following Helm values:

* `queue.artifact_region`
* `queue.public_artifact_bucket` (bucket name, e.g., `my-public-artifacts`)
* `queue.private_artifact_bucket` (same)
* `queue.sign_public_artifact_urls` (optional, default false)
* `queue.worker_info_update_frequency` (optional, default 30m)
* `queue.public_artifact_bucket_cdn` (optional)
* `queue.aws_access_key_id`
* `queue.aws_secret_access_key`
* `queue.aws_endpoint` (optional; use this to interface with non-AWS services' S3-compatibility support)
* `queue.aws_force_path_style` (optional; use this to interface with non-AWS services' S3-compatibility support)
* `queue.aws_skip_cors_configuration` (optional; default false. Use this to interface with non-AWS services' S3-compatibility support)

The service uses the public bucket for artifacts having prefix `public/`, and the private bucket for all others.
Both buckets must be in the given `artifact_region`.

In a public deployment of Taskcluster, it may make sense to allow public read access to the public bucket, in which case setting `sign_public_artifact_urls` to false will allow simpler (unsigned) URLs for public artifacts.
A further optional step is to configure a CDN such as CloudFront to serve artifacts from this bucket, with a URL prefix given in `public_artifact_bucket_cdn`.
Paths on the CDN should match those on the bucket, and the configured URL must use `https` and must not end in a `/` character.

If the public bucket is not readable, then `sign_public_artifact_urls` must be true and `public_artifact_bucket_cdn` is not used.

The given AWS credentials should have the following policy:

```json
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectTagging",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::PUBLIC_BUCKET/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::PRIVATE_BUCKET/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetBucketTagging",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutBucketCORS",
                "s3:GetBucketCORS"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::PUBLIC_BUCKET",
                "arn:aws:s3:::PRIVATE_BUCKET"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Task Claim Timeout

The `queue.task_claim_timeout` gives the time, in seconds, that a claim returned from the `queue.claimWork` endpoint will last.
The default value is 20 minutes (1200).

A worker executing a task must "reclaim" before this time has expired, or lose its claim on the task.
This functionality is used to recover tasks from crashed workers.
Workers also discover that their claimed task has been cancelled at reclaim time; there is no immediate queue-to-worker communication path.
Workers attempt to claim well before the deadline, but must not constantly re-claim.

When changing this configuration value, balance the following concerns:
* A shorter time will increase load on the queue service, proportional to the number of concurrently executing tasks.
* A shorter time will decrease the time a worker "wastes" continuing to execute a cancelled task.
* A shorter time will increase the likelihood of a functional worker losing its claim due to delays in reclaiming caused by high load.
* A shorter time will increase the accuracy of the queue's notion of whether a worker is "alive".

In practice, a value less than 5 minutes (300) is not recommended.

## Task Cache

Because a task (but not its status) is immutable after it is created, the queue can aggressively cache task definitions.
The `queue.task_cache_max_size` Helm value, defaulting to 10, controls the size of this in-memory, per-process LRU cache.
If queries to the `tasks` table from `taskcluster-queue-web` are causing issues with the backend database, increase this value to 1000 or more.
