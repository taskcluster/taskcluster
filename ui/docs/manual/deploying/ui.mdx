# User Interface

## Banner

Setting the `ui.banner` Helm variable to a non-empty string will cause a banner announcement to appear on users screens.
This can be helpful for announcing planned downtimes.

## Site-Specific Documentation

The Taskcluster documentation is a sub-section of the Taskcluster UI.
It is a copy of the data presented at https://docs.taskcluster.net, but can be customized for the particular deployment.

This is accomplished by configuring the `ui.site_specific` Helm configuration.
All values are optional, and if they are not set then the corresponding snippet of documentation will be omitted.

```yaml
ui:
  site_specific:
    # The URL to which users should go to configure the taskcluster-github app
    github_app_url: ..
    # A workerPoolId that most people have access to, for use in the documentation tutorial
    tutorial_worker_pool_id: ..
    # user-visible usernames for notify
    notify_email_sender: ..
    notify_matrix_bot_name: ..
    notify_slack_bot_name: ..

```

These values are also used occasionally elsewhere in the UI.

## Login Strategies

The taskcluster-ui and taskcluster-web-server services work together to support configurable login strategies for the Taskcluster UI.
These are configured with the `web_server.ui_login_strategies` and `ui.ui_login_strategy_names` Helm variables.

The first, `web_server.ui_login_strategies`, is a JSON string containing configuration for the desired strategies, defined below.

For example:

```yaml
web_server:
  ui_login_strategies:
    github:
      ...
```

The second, `ui.ui_login_strategy_names,` should be equal to the set of keys in `ui_login_strategies`, but *must not contain secrets* as it is sent to the browser.

### GitHub

In order to enable the GitHub login strategy, specify the GitHub client ID and secret for an OAuth application created for use against this service and its web UI.
Create it under "Settings" (for yourself or for an org) -> "Developer Settings" -> "OAuth Apps" -> "New OAuth App".
The name for the app is not critical, but we suggest something like "&lt;deployment-name>-taskcluster-signin".

The callback URL should be `<rootUrl>/login/github/callback`, or `http://localhost:3050/login/github/callback` for local development.

Configure it as:

```yaml
web_server:
  ui_login_strategies:
    github:
      clientId: ...
      clientSecret: ...
```

### Mozilla Auth0

This strategy is specifically tuned to the integration Mozilla has built with Auth0.
This integration includes many pieces, such as CIS and the People API, which are probably not available outside of Mozilla.
Deployments outside of Mozilla should not enable this strategy.

To get started, request a new Auth0 application via Hub ("New Single Sign On Application").
Specify that you want a client with scopes `display:null`, `classification:public`, `display:all`, and `display:public`.
Use OpenID Connect.
The Callback URL should be `<rootUrl>/login/mozilla-auth0/callback` or `http://localhost:3050/login/mozilla-auth0/callback` for local development.
The other options are up to you.

In response, you will get a domain, client ID, and client secret.
Configure these as follows:

```yaml
web_server:
  ui_login_strategies:
    mozilla-auth0:
      domain: "<auth0 subdomain>",
      clientId: "<clientId from registration of client>",
      clientSecret: "<clientSecret from registration of client>"
```
