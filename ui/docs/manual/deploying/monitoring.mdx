# Monitoring Services

## New Relic

Taskcluster services *optionally* support New Relic.
To enable this support, add a top-level Helm property named `newRelic` containing a JSON object with [New Relic environment variables](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration) and their values.
This will be distributed to all services.

```yaml
newRelic:
  NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: my-app
  NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: 12345
  # ...
```

## Background Processes

Taskcluster has several background processes that you should ensure are running on a schedule. Any of the following will generate messages
of the form:

```json
{
  "Type": "monitor.periodic",
  "Logger": "<Logger>",
  "Fields": {
    "name": "<Name>"
  }
}
```

They will also have Fields for `status`, `duration`, and a serialized `error` if an error occured.

The processes that have `continuous` for their deadline and schedule run every few minutes and should complete fairly quickly. The rest
have their schedules and maximum allowed duration defined here. All times are relative to the timezone of the k8s cluster.

## Prometheus Metrics


Taskcluster can be configured to expose metrics for Prometheus scraping. This is supported via a monitor plugin, which starts a metrics server on configured service and background job when enabled.

To enable Prometheus metrics, add a top-level `prometheus` property to your Helm values file:

```yaml
prometheus:
  enabled: true
  prefix: tc
  server:
    ip: 0.0.0.0
    port: 9100
```

- `enabled`: Set to `true` to enable metrics.
- `prefix`: (Optional) Prefix for all metric names (will not be prefixed by default).
- `server.ip`: (Optional) IP address to bind the metrics server (default: `127.0.0.1`).
- `server.port`: (Optional) Port for the metrics server (default: `9100`).

Each service and background job will expose a `/metrics` endpoint on the configured port for Prometheus to scrape.

If your Kubernetes cluster does not support the `monitoring.googleapis.com/v1/PodMonitoring` resource, add `"podmonitoring"` to `.skipResourceTypes[]` in your Helm values to prevent deployment failures.

Below is the list of services and jobs that expose metrics:
