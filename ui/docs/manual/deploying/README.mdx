# Deploying Taskcluster

A Taskcluster deployment is identified by a `rootUrl`, which defines the domain name on which the deployment can be accessed.

Taskcluster is deployed as a collection of interacting microservices within a Kubernetes cluster.
The cluster has an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) that routes various paths under the `rootUrl` to the appropriate services.
The `/` path is routed to the taskcluster-ui service, which serves a browser-based user interface.

The services all run from a single Docker image, referred to as the "monoimage", that is built by running `yarn release` (or `yarn build` to build a one-off) in this repository.
A Taskcluster "release" is a semantically versioned docker image along with the repository at that tag (for deployment configuration) and similarly-tagged client libraries in various languages.

<Warning>
The "Deploying Taskcluster" section is incomplete, as we iterate to find a suitable approach to deployment.
Pull Requests to improve this section are welcome.
</Warning>

## Configuration

A Taskcluster deployment's configuration comes in the form of Helm "values".
Most of those are undocumented, but see:
 * [static clients](/docs/manual/deploying/static-clients)

## Clouds

Taskcluster is a multi-cloud system, and as such expects credentials for several cloud providers.

The services' Kubernetes deployment can run anywhere; at Mozilla it is deployed in GKE, Google Cloud's Kubernetes offering.
Task artifacts are stored in Amazon S3, so AWS credentials will be required.
Services' data is stored in Azure Table Storage, so Azure credentials will be required.

Taskcluster can dynamically provision workers in a variety of clouds; see the [workers](/docs/manual/deploying/workers) page for for details.

Taskcluster can also generate temporary credentials for supported clouds.
See [Cloud Credentials](/docs/manual/deploying/cloud-credentials) for details.

## GitHub

Taskcluster can integrate with GitHub in two complementary ways:
* The taskcluster-github service provides a GitHub App which can create tasks in response to events in GitHub repositories. See [Github Integration](/docs/manual/deploying/github) for more details.
* The web-server service supports user logins via GitHub.  See [Login Strategies](/docs/manual/deploying/login-strategies) for more details.

## Events

Taskcluster requires an AMQP message bus to support passing events between services.
See [Pulse](/docs/manual/deploying/pulse) for more details.

## User Login

The Taskcluster UI allows users to login using configurable "strategies".
See [Login Strategies](/docs/manual/deploying/login-strategies) for more details.

### Third Party Login

Third party sites can fetch Taskcluster credentials for their users. See [Third Party](/docs/manual/deploying/third-party) for more details.

## Testing and Monitoring

The [Monitoring](/docs/manual/deploying/monitoring) page gives some guidance on monitoring Taskcluster's operation.
There is also a [smoketest](/docs/manual/deploying/smoketests) suite that can be used to make a quick check of a Taskcluster deployment's functionality.
