# Static Clients

As a collection of microservices, Taskcluster services must be able to communicate with one another.
They use the same [authorization system](/docs/manual/design/apis/hawk) as external clients.
This means that each service needs a clientId and accessToken, and that clientId must be associated with specific scopes.

## Static Clients

The Auth service supports this with a feature called "static clients".
All clientIds beginning with `static/` are considered static clients.
These are configured in the Auth service's `STATIC_CLIENTS` and cannot be modified via the API.
The configuration is a JSON blob with the form

```json
[
    {clientId: 'static/taskcluster/index', accessToken: '<secret value>'},
    {clientId: 'static/my-client', accessToken: '<secret value>', description: 'Client for index', scopes: [
        'some-scope', 'another-scope']]},
    ...,
]
```

Note that clients beginning with `static/taskcluster/` must not specify scopes or description (those are determined automatically), while those not beginning with `static/taskcluster/` *must* specify scopes and description.
Most deployments do not use non-taskcluster static credentials, but they are available to support some advanced "locked-down" scenarios.

## Configuring AccessTokens

Taskcluster expects the person configuring the deployment to configure the same accessToken for each service both in that service's settings and in `STATIC_CLIENTS`.
An access token must be a random string from 22 to 66 characters in length.

An access token is required for each Taskcluster service, as well as one for `static/taskcluster/root`, which is an account with `*` scope, used for bootstrapping administration of a deployment.
The Auth service will fail to start up if `STATIC_CLIENTS` is missing any `static/taskcluster/...` clients, or if it contains unrecognized clients.

## Changes when Upgrading

When a service is added or removed from Taskcluster, the change is considered major.
In this case, `STATIC_CLIENTS` will need to be modified to add or remove the accessToken for the added or removed service.
Failure to do so will result in the Auth service failing to start up.
