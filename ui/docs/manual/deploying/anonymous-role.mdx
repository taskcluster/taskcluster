title: Anonymous Role

# Anonymous Role

A single scope `assume:anonymous` will be granted for all calls (with or without credentials).
The `anonymous` role is aimed at private Taskcluster installations. With this, it will
be possible to prevent any useful access to the Taskcluster deployment without credentials
allowing for greater administrator control over "public" endpoints.

## Public Deployments

All API calls are granted the scope `assume:anonymous`.
In order to allow unauthenticated API, grant the relevant scopes to the `anonymous` role.
A "public" deployment of Taskcluster, allowing unauthenticated read-only access, would grant the following scopes:

  - `auth:current-scopes`
  - `auth:expand-scopes`
  - `auth:get-client:*`
  - `auth:get-role:*`
  - `auth:list-clients`
  - `auth:list-roles`
  - `github:get-badge:*`
  - `github:get-repository:*`
  - `github:latest-status:*`
  - `github:list-builds`
  - `hooks:get:*`
  - `hooks:list-hooks:*`
  - `hooks:list-last-fires:*`
  - `hooks:status:*`
  - `index:find-task:*`
  - `index:list-namespaces:*`
  - `index:list-tasks:*`
  - `purge-cache:all-purge-requests`
  - `purge-cache:purge-requests:*`
  - `queue:get-artifact:public/*`
  - `queue:get-provisioner:*`
  - `queue:get-task:*`
  - `queue:get-worker-type:*`
  - `queue:get-worker:*`
  - `queue:list-artifacts:*`
  - `queue:list-dependent-tasks:*`
  - `queue:list-provisioners`
  - `queue:list-task-group:*`
  - `queue:list-worker-types:*`
  - `queue:list-workers:*`
  - `queue:pending-count:*`
  - `queue:status:*`
  - `secrets:list-secrets`
  - `web:read-pulse`
  - `worker-manager:get-worker-pool:*`
  - `worker-manager:get-worker:*`
  - `worker-manager:list-providers`
  - `worker-manager:list-worker-pool-errors:*`
  - `worker-manager:list-worker-pools`
  - `worker-manager:list-workers:*`

## Private Deployments

In order to disallow access to unauthenticated APIs, leave the `anonymous` role empty. Alternatively, pick and
choose specific unauthenticated APIs to make available to anonymous requests.

Note that in the case of a private deployment, you will want to ensure that the `queue.signPublicArtifactUrls` deployment configuration is true.
Otherwise, artifacts with a `public/` prefix will redirect to an un-signed S3 bucket URL.
