# Websocktunnel

[Websocktunnel](/docs/reference/tools/websocktunnel) is a service that allows its clients to publicly expose specific HTTP services without publicly exposing the entire host.
Taskcluster workers use this service to expose live-logs and interactive sessions without having a public IP.

## Configuration

Configuration is via environment variables:

* `URL_PREFIX` gives the URL prefix (http(s)://hostname(:port)) at which this service is publicly exposed.
  This is used to generate public URLs pointing to the service.
* `ENV` defines the runtime environment; use `ENV=production` for production deployments.
* `SYSLOG_ADDR` (optional) defines a syslog server to which log messages will be sent in production
* `TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_SECRET_A` and `TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_SECRET_B` define two secrets, either of which may be used to sign valid JWTs.
  Either secret is accepted, supporting downtime-free rotation of secrets.
* `TLS_KEY` and `TLS_CERTIFICATE` (both optional) define a TLS certificate that is used for the main HTTP service.
  If not given, the service will default to plain HTTP.
  This is not recommended for production usage!
* `PORT` gives the port on which the HTTP server should run, defaulting to 443 (or if not using TLS, 80).
* `AUDIENCE` (aud) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. Use of this is OPTIONAL.

In non-production mode, the service logs its activities to stdout in a human-readable format.

## Deployment

The service is deployed from a Docker image containing only the single, statically-linked binary.
You can find the docker image on Docker hub at `taskcluster/websocktunnel:<version>` or build it yourself with `docker build .`.
The image should be run with the environment variables described above, and the container's port exposed on the Docker host.
Use the same value for PORT as the port exposed on the host (typically 443), as the service will include that port in the URLs it generates.

## Scaling

In large-scale deployment scenarios, there will be thousands of idle client connections waiting for incoming viewer requests.
This number of connections can easily overwhelm a server, even if the total traffic bandwidth does not.
To cope with this situation, create multiple Websocktunnel instances, each with a different hostname, and configure clients to connect to a specific instance.
How clients are assigned to instances is up to you, but keep in mind that clients may reconnect on connection failure, but if they do not reconnect to the same Websocktunnel instance, then the URL for that client will change.
