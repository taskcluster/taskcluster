# Standard Environment Variables

Taskcluster defines several environment variables, with the following meanings.
Each section also describes the conditions where a Taskcluster component sets the variable, and those where a component expects the variable to be set.

## TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL

`TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` is the root URL for the current Taskcluster deployment.
It is typically set during task execution by worker implementations.
The value is used by [client libraries](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries) by calling functions like `fromEnvVars` or `optionsFromEnvironment`.

The root URL serves as a scope for `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, etc. which only have meaning in a single deployment.

## TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID

`TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID` is the clientId to use for Taskcluster API calls.

This is read by [client libraries](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries) using functions like `fromEnvVars` or `optionsFromEnvironment`.
The `taskcluster-cli` command `taskcluster signin` sets this and related variables in a shell environment.

## TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN

`TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` contains the accessToken for the clientId given in `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, and is handled in just like that variable.

## TASKCLUSTER_CERTIFICATE

`TASKCLUSTER_CERTIFICATE` contains the certificate for the clientId given in `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, and is only present if the client is a temporary client.
This variable is handled just like `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`.

## TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL

`TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL` defines the URL of a local [taskcluster-proxy](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy) instance that can proxy requests on behalf of the current task.
It is typically set during task execution by worker implementations, if taskcluster-proxy is supported.
The URL can be treated like a root URL, but one that does not require any clientId, accessToken, or certificate.
For example, it can be passed to a client constructor as in `new Auth({rootUrl: process.environ['TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL']})`.

## TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION

`TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION` provides physical location information of the instance to task. It is a [json](http://www.json.org/) parseable string.
The [taskcluster-worker README file](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-worker-runner/blob/master/README.md) contains the details of the fields
present for each cloud provider.
