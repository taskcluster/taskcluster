# Standard Environment Variables

Taskcluster defines several environment variables, with the following meanings.
Each section also describes the conditions where a Taskcluster component sets
the variable, and those where a component expects the variable to be set.

## TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL

`TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` is the [root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls) for the current Taskcluster deployment.
It is typically set during task execution by worker implementations.  The value
is used by [client libraries](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries) by
calling functions like `fromEnvVars` or `optionsFromEnvironment`.

The root URL serves as a scope for `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, etc. which only
have meaning in a single deployment.

## TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID

`TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID` is the clientId to use for Taskcluster API calls.

This is read by [client libraries](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries)
using functions like `fromEnvVars` or `optionsFromEnvironment`. The
`taskcluster-cli` command `taskcluster signin` sets this and related variables
in a shell environment.

## TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN

`TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` contains the accessToken for the clientId given in
`TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, and is handled in just like that variable.

## TASKCLUSTER_CERTIFICATE

`TASKCLUSTER_CERTIFICATE` contains the certificate for the clientId given in
`TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`, and is only present if the client is a temporary
client.  This variable is handled just like `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`.

## TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL

`TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL` defines the URL of a local
[taskcluster-proxy](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy) instance
that can proxy requests on behalf of the current task.  It is typically set
during task execution by worker implementations, if taskcluster-proxy is
supported.  The URL can be treated like a root URL, but one that does not
require any clientId, accessToken, or certificate.  For example, it can be
passed to a client constructor as in
`new Auth({rootUrl: process.environ['TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL']})`.

## TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION

`TASKCLUSTER_WORKER_LOCATION` provides physical location information of the
instance to task. It is a [json](http://www.json.org/) parseable string.
