# Structured Logs

Taskcluster services ouptut log data in a format that is suitable for automated consumption -- structured logging.
The log data takes the form of a single-line JSON object.

## Log Entry Properties

Log messages are output in a format that is a superset of the "mozlog" format expected of critical services at Mozilla, and the format required for Google Stackdriver logging.
The fields are:

```yaml
{
  "Timestamp": ... # <time since unix epoch in nanoseconds>,
  "Type": "...", # message type
  "message": "...", # a plain-text version of the message (optional)
  "serviceContext": {"service": "..."}, # TC service producing the data
  "Logger": "...", # component within the service producing the data
  "Hostname": "...", # (not useful in most deployments)
  "Severity": ..., # numeric syslog severity
  "severity": ..., # corresponding upper-case severity name
  "Pid": ..., # (not useful in most deployments)
  "Fields": {...}
  "EnvVersion": "2.0", # defines the version of the log format
}
```

The content of `Fields` can be any arbitary data but certain `Type`s are defined
in the docs site where we ensure that for any messages with that type, the content
of `Fields` will contain certain keys.

The [reference documentation](/docs/reference) defines the log messages output by each service and the meaning assigned to their fields.
