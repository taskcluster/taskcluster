Taskcluster uses a microservices architecture, with each service exposing a
small set of API endpoints. Those endpoints, and other details of the
services, are documented in the [reference component](/docs/reference).
We have already mentioned several services, especially the Queue service.

This section describes in detail how to interact with these Microservices.
