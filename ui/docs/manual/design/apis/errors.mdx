# API Errors

API clients should be prepared to receive HTTP errors in response to API calls.

## Retries

HTTP Errors in the 5xx series should generally be re-tried using an exponential
backoff. The provided API clients handle this for you.

## Resiliency

Clients should also be resilient to arbitrary response content: intermediate
proxies and load balancers may produce HTML error messages rather than the
expected valid JSON.

## API-Specific Errors

Errors returned from the API implementation have a JSON body with the following format:

```js
{
  "code": "TooManyFoos",
  "message": "You can only have 3 foos\n----\nmethod: toomanyfoos\nerrorCode: TooManyFoos\nstatusCode: 472 \ntime: 2017-01-22T21:20:16.650Z",
  "requestInfo":{
    "method": "toomanyfoos",
    "params": {},
    "payload": {"foos":[4, 5]},
    "time": "2017-01-22T21:20:16.650Z",
  },
}
```

The `code` property identifies the error itself.  The codes that are common to all
services (defined in [taskcluster-lib-api](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-api))
are described below, but specific services may add additional service-specific
error codes, documented in the reference section.

The `message` is suitable for display to users. It contains a detailed error
message and some basic information about the request.

The additional `requestInfo` fields describe the request that caused the error
in more detail, and may be useful for "advanced" users. The included `payload`
may have been modified to remove potentially sensitive information, and can be
safely shown to the user in an error message.

### MalformedPayload: 400

The method expects a payload, but the request body was not JSON

### InvalidRequestArguments: 400

The provided query strings or parameters are invalid

### InputValidationError: 400

The payload was valid JSON, but did not match the documented schema

### InputError: 400

The input was invalid for some other reason (described in the message)

### AuthenticationFailed: 401

Hawk authentication failed. The corresponding message is generally very terse,
to avoid providing extra information that might help an attacker guess valid
credentials.

### InsufficientScopes: 403

The hawk authentication succeeded (or there was no Hawk header), but the scopes
associated with that authentication were not sufficient for the requested
operation.

### ResourceNotFound: 404

The requested resource wasn't found

### RequestConflict: 409

The request conflicts with server state.  This can occur when a "create"
operation occurs for a resource that already exists.  Most "create" operations
are idempotent, meaning that two create calls for exactly the same resource
will both succeed, but if the two calls specify different payloads, a
RequestConflict error will result.

### ResourceExpired: 410

The resource existed, but has expired.

### InputTooLarge: 413

The provided payload is too big.

### InternalServerError: 500

An internal error occurred. The error message is not returned, lest it expose
security-sensitive issues, but is logged and available to Taskcluster
administrators.
