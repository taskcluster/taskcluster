# Pulse

Pulse is a message bus: it allows participants to publish messages and other
participants to subscribe to those messages. Taskcluster uses this bus to
communicate between microservices, notifying interested parties when specific
events have occurred. The system is based on AMQP in a publish-subscribe
configuration.

Pulse is a publicly accessible service, and the pulse message schemas are a
part of Taskcluster's published API, so they make a nicely decoupled
integration point for external services.

## Background

Mozilla, where Taskcluster began, has an organization-wide "message bus" called
"pulse". The idea is that systems within Mozilla should publish events to this
bus, and other systems can then consume those events. This has enabled
development of lots of interesting pieces of automation. It was a natural
choice to publish Taskcluster-related events to this message bus, and to also
consume such events from the bus.

That said, Taskcluster does not consume events from other Mozilla services, and
can use any other RabbitMQ service just as easily.  It does use some
RabbitMQ-specific extensions. It follows the [pulse
specification](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/Pulse#Specification),
so any RabbitMQ service configured in a manner compatible with that specification
should work.

Consider the use of the term "pulse" within Taskcluster to mean
"pulse-compatible RabbitMQ".

### Pulse Specficiation, Abbreviated

The pulse specification is summarized here for posterity:

---

Pulse (the server):

* MUST support AMQP 0-9-1 and these RabbitMQ extensions:

  * Confirms
  * Consumer Prefetch
  * Queue Length Limit
  * Sender-selected Distribution

* SHOULD exhibit deliver-at-least-once semantics
* MAY delete queues that grows beyond Pulse defined limits
* SHALL notify owner by email when a queue grows close to Pulse-defined limits.

Publishers:

* SHOULD use confirm-publish channels

Exchanges:

* MUST be named `exchange/<clientId>/<name>`
* MUST be topic exchanges
* MUST be durable

Messages:

* MUST be UTF-8-encoded JSON
* MUST carry application/json as Content-Type
* SHOULD be durable
* SHOULD be less than 8 KiB (for good performance)
* MAY be CC'ed to multiple routing keys
* MUST NOT contain private or sensitive information
* SHOULD have a routing key where fields have a fixed index from the left

Subscribers:

* SHOULD specify a consumer prefetch limit

Queues:

* MUST be named `queue/<clientId>/<name>`
* MAY have a limited length
* MUST not grow unbounded

## Taskcluster Pulse Resources

In accordance with the specification, Taskcluster names its queues with the
prefix `queue/<namespace>/`, and exchanges with the prefix
`exchange/<namespace>/`. This guarantees that messages on an exchange named,
for example, `exchange/taskcluster-queue/v1/task-defined`, came from the
Taskcluster queue service.

All Taskcluster AMQP exchanges are `topic` exchanges (as per the
specification). Message bodies are always JSON, and messages are "copied" to
multiple routing keys using the AMQP `Cc` header.

For routing keys Taskcluster always has the same format for all messages on a
given exchange, and uses `-` if no value makes sense for the given routing key
entry with a specific message.

Each service's reference documentation describes the events the service sends
(if any). Each kind of event is sent on a different exchange, and each event
has a routing key containing characteristics of the event on which consumers
might like to filter.
