All Taskcluster endpoints are guarded by [scopes](scopes). The authentication
information passed with each API call is used to determine a set of scopes
associated with the caller. These are compared against the scopes required by
the endpoint. If they are satisfied, the request is allowed to proceed.

The scopes required for each endpoint are documented in the reference section
of this manual. Note that some API endpoints may have additional scope
requirements that depend on the body of the request; read the endpoint
documentation carefully to discover these.

See [the taskcluster-auth
docs](/docs/reference/platform/auth/scopes) for more detailed
information on scopes, scope satisfaction, and stars in scopes.
