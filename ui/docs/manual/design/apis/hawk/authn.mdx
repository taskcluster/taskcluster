To access protected resources, a Taskcluster client must have credentials
consisting of a `clientId` and an `accessToken` (and, if using temporary
credentials, a `certificate`).

These credentials are used with the [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk)
protocol to authenticate each HTTP request. The `clientId` is passed as the
`id` parameter, and `accessToken` is passed as the `key` parameter.

If given, the certificate is passed as `ext.certificate` to the
`Hawk.client.header` method. The `ext` value is a base64-encoded JSON string.

In JavaScript:
```js
var header = Hawk.client.header('https://foo.taskcluster.net', 'GET', {
  credentials: {
    clientId: clientId,
    accessToken: accessToken,
  },
  ext: new Buffer(JSON.stringify({certificate: certificate})).toString('base64'),
});
```

Given this information, the Hawk protocol (as defined by its Javascript
implementation) signs the HTTP request, and the resulting token is placed in
the `Authorization` header.
