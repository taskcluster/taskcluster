# Roles

A _role_ consists of a `roleId`, a set of scopes, and a description. Each role
constitutes a simple _expansion rule_ that says if you have the scope
`assume:<roleId>` you get the set of scopes associated with the role named
`roleId`. Roles can refer to other roles in the same way.

See [the taskcluster-auth
docs](/docs/reference/platform/auth/roles) for more detailed
information on roles and role expansion.

## In Practice

In practice, roles are used in a few ways within Taskcluster:

 * As a shorthand for a commonly-used set of scopes
 * As a means of associating scopes with external things such as source-code repositories or users
 * As a way to configure scopes for Taskcluster resources like hooks or worker pools
 * As a scope allowing the bearer to "assume" the named role.

See the [namespaces](/docs/manual/using/namespaces) document for more information.

The set of defined roles is visible in the Taskcluster UI.  This interface
helpfully shows both the scopes configured for the role, and the "expanded
scopes" for that role. The latter value can be a little misleading for
`*`-suffixed roles, so be careful and if in doubt, create a throwaway client to
test your assumptions.
