Hawk allows you to generate a
[_bewit_](https://github.com/hapijs/hawk#single-uri-authorization) signature
for any `GET` request. Including this _bewit_ signature in your request will
then authenticate and authorize the request. All Taskcluster APIs support
authentication of `GET` requests using these bewit signatures.  This is most
commonly used to generate URLs to download private artifacts, such as
`https://taskcluster.example.com/task/<taskId>/artifacts/<name>?bewit=..`.

You'll find that the supported [Taskcluster
clients](/docs/manual/using/integration/libraries) offer APIs for generating
signed URLs.
