Taskcluster authentication begins with "clients". Each client has a name
(`clientId`) and a secret access token. These can be used together to make API
requests to Taskcluster services. Each client has a set of scopes associated
with it, controlling what that client can do.

See [the taskcluster-auth
docs](/docs/reference/platform/auth/clients) for more detailed
information.

The set of defined clients is visible in the "Clients" tool in the Taskcluster
UI.  This interface helpfully shows both the scopes configured for the client,
and the "expanded scopes" that result after all roles are expanded. Note that,
in keeping with the open nature of Taskcluster, anyone can see the full list of
clients.

**NOTE** Taskcluster does not identify users. All API calls are made with
Taskcluster credentials, which include a `clientId`, but that identifier does
not necessarily relate to a specific person or "user account" of any sort.
