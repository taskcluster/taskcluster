# Temporary Credentials

Any client with a `clientId` and an `accessToken` can issue temporary
credentials. Temporary credentials consist of a `clientId`, `accessToken` and a
certificate validating them. The scopes associated with temporary credentials
must be satisfied by the issuing client's scopes.

Because temporary credentials can be created anywhere, there is no central
registry of temporary credentials, and they cannot be listed (or revoked)
anywhere in the Taskcluster API.

## Certificates

A certificate looks like this:

```js
ext = {
  // ...
  certificate: {
    version:          1,
    issuer:           "issuing-client-id",
    scopes:           ['ScopeA', 'ScopeB'],
    start:            1410399435102,
    expiry:           1410399497349,
    seed:             'KpJvYUNXSYeWqc0vnsAq9wJJgvWv5pTh6IYhd120YZTQ',
    signature:        'Yw1ETAM+6PGA0T65IAEShwyDLDQqw7M8qpFzLpG+Nm8='
  }
}
```

The certificate is always issued by a client, called the `issuer`, in this case
`issuing-client-id`.  The issuer's `accessToken` will be used to sign the
temporary credentials.  A set of temporary credentials cannot be used to issue
new temporary credentials, but they be used to generate signed URLs for
untrusted sources.

The `clientId` used with the temporary credentials may be any id for which the
issuer has the scope `auth:create-client:<clientId>`.

In the certificate the `version` must always be `1` (at least for now).

The `scopes` property is the list of scopes associated with the temporary
credentials.  This must be satisfied by the issuer's scopes. In other words,
the temporary credentials cannot have any scope that the issuer does not have.

The `start` and `expiry` properties are the validity start and expiration of the
certificate, respectively. Both `start` and `expiry` are in milliseconds since
UNIX epoch, and these cannot be more than 31 days apart. Notice that it is
allowed to issue temporary credentials that take effect in the future, useful
for delegating access to scheduled tasks. The auth service tolerates up to five
minutes clock skew between client and server, so temporary credentials should
not apply any clock skew adjustment themselves.

The `seed` property is a 44 character string of random characters. It used for
construction of the `accessToken`, as detailed later.

The `signature` property validates the authenticity of the certificate and is
generated as detailed below.

## Signature Generation

The signature for a certificate is generated by the issuer, using its access
token. The issuer does this by generating a base64 encoded SHA256 HMAC
signature of the following string:
```
version:1\n
clientId:<clientId>\n
issuer:<issuer>\n
seed:<seed>\n
start:<start>\n
expiry:<expiry>\n
scopes:\n
<scopes[0]>\n
<scopes[1]>\n
...
<scopes[n]>
```

Where `<clientId>` is the id that will be used with the temporary credentials.
As described above, this can be any id that the issuer is permitted to create.

In the certificate example from previous section, the string to sign would be:

```
version:1\n
clientId:temporary-cred-client-id\n
issuer:issuing-client-id\n
seed:KpJvYUNXSYeWqc0vnsAq9wJJgvWv5pTh6IYhd120YZTQ\n
start:1410399435102\n
expiry:1410399497349\n
scopes:\n
ScopeA\n
ScopeB
```

An authenticating server will validate the certificate on every request, using
the above signature algorithm.

## Construction of `accessToken`

The `accessToken` must also be generated by the issuer. The issuer does this
by generating a SHA256 HMAC signature of the `seed` from the certificate,
signed with the issuers `accessToken`.

The signature must be encoded using URL-safe base64 encoding without `=`
padding. See [RFC 4648, sec. 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5)
for details on URL-safe base64. Basically it amounts to replacing `+` with `-`
and replacing `/` with `_`, and then drop `=` padding.

The resulting HMAC signature is the `accessToken`, which should be given to
client that will be using the temporary credentials. The `accessToken` will be
reconstructed on the authenticating server for each request.

## Anonymous Temporary Credentials

For backward compatibility, Taskcluster supports "anonymous" temporary
credentials. For these credentials, the temporary credentials use the issuer's
`clientId`.

In this case, the certificate does not include an `issuer` property, and the
`clientId` and `issuer` lines are omitted from the string used to generate the
signature:

```
version:1\n
seed:<seed>\n
start:<start>\n
expiry:<expiry>\n
scopes:\n
<scopes[0]>\n
<scopes[1]>\n
...
<scopes[n]>
```

We recommend that you always use named temporary credentials, with a
descriptive `clientId`, to assist in debugging and logging.
