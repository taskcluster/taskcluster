title: API Authentication and Authorization
order: 10
---

All Taskcluster components use [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) over
SSL for authentication and authorize access based on a set of "scopes"
associated with each client. Credentials and scopes are managed by the
[authentication](/docs/reference/platform/auth/api) component.

The details are documented here, but note that you can use one of the fine
[Taskcluster clients](/docs/manual/tools/clients) to handle all of these details for
you. They are available in a variety of languages, and are kept up-to-date
with the latest APIs.
