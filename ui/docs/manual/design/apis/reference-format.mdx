# Reference Formats

Most Taskcluster services make heavy use of JSON schemas for validation of
incoming and outgoing data, whether through APIs or AMQP exchanges. This makes
the external API surface very reliable and consistent, and helps avoid a lot of
bugs and typos.

The use of JSON schemas also makes it very easy to **generate documentation**
for all the external interfaces offered by Taskcluster components, as done on
this site. To further simplify the generation of documentation and API-clients
we have formalized formats for describing interfaces.

This document describes the formats in which references for API end-points and
AMQP exchanges are documented. 

## Reference Manifest

All services are linked in a reference manifest, available at `/references/manifest.json` on any Taskcluster deployment.
The file contains links to reference documents for specific services.

The schema for the reference manifest is as follows:

<SchemaTable schema="/schemas/common/manifest-v3.json" />

## Reference Documents

The format of each linked reference document is identified by its schema.
In particular, schema has a `metadata` property containing `name` and `version` properties that define the type of reference and the version of the schema.
Software which interprets the references should use these `name` and `version` fields to identify documents it understands, and ignore documents it does not understand.

That metadata is defined in a meta-schema:

<SchemaTable schema="/schemas/common/metadata-metaschema.json" />

Note that the manifest document also adheres to the metaschema.

### API References

API reference files have metadata name `api`.

Taskcluster API calls are REST-like HTTP transactions, and the API reference
describes how to formulate a request and what to expect in the response.  This
includes an HTTP method, a route, and (for calls with a request body) an input
schema.

The route includes some parameters where user data (such as a `taskId`) can be
substituted.  The request URL is formed from the Taskcluster rootUrl, the
service name, the API version, and the post-substitution route.
[Taskcluster-lib-urls](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-urls)
provides an `api` method to perform this operation.

An API end-point can take a JSON entity body as input and return a JSON entity
body, both of which are governed by a schema. Input is always validated by the
server before it is accepted, and output is validated before it is returned.
Note that clients should not re-validate output against the declared schema, as
server responses may change by adding additional properties.

The API reference format has the following format:

<SchemaTable schema="/schemas/common/api-reference-v0.json" />

### Pulse Exchange References

Each service which sends Pulse messages has its exchanges and messages defined
in a reference document with metadata name `exchanges` and the following format.

<SchemaTable schema="/schemas/common/exchanges-reference-v0.json" />

Messages are validated on the server prior to publication.
Note that clients should not validate received messages against the declared
schema, as messages may be changed by adding additional properties.

### Log References

Each service generates log messages that match formats defined in log references.
These reference documents have metadata name `logs` and the following schema:

<SchemaTable schema="/schemas/common/logs-reference-v0.json" />

## Rolled-Up References

If you are tempted to "crawl" a Taskcluster deployment to get its references and schemas, `/references/references.json` may save you some time.
It contains an array of all reference and schema files, each in the shape `{content, filename}` where filename is the URL path relative to the deployment's rootUrl.
Schema `$id`'s are represented with relative URLs.

For example:

```json
{
    "filename": "schemas/common/api-reference-v0.json",
    "content": {
        "$id": "/schemas/common-api-reference-v0.json#",
        ..
    }
}
```
