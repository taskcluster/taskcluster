# Metrics

Taskcluster services output metrics data for monitoring and observability. Metrics are quantitative measurements — such as counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries — that help track the behavior and performance of services over time.

Metrics are typically consumed by Prometheus, which can scrape and visualize these values for alerting and analysis.

## Metric Registration

Metrics must be registered before they can be used. Registration is performed using the `MonitorManager.registerMetric` method. Each metric has a unique name, type, and associated metadata.

**Example registration:**

```js
MonitorManager.registerMetric({
  name: 'queue_tasks_created',
  type: 'counter',
  title: 'Tasks Created',
  description: 'Number of tasks created by the service',
  labels: { provisionerId: 'Provisioner ID', workerType: 'Type of worker' },
  registers: ['default'],
});
```

### Registration Fields

- `name` (string): Unique identifier for the metric (must match `/^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$/`).
- `type` (string): One of `counter`, `gauge`, `histogram`, or `summary`.
- `title` (string): Human-readable title for the metric.
- `description` (string): Description of what the metric measures.
- `labels` (object, optional): Key-value pairs describing label names and their meaning.
- `registers` (array): List of registers (default is `['default']`). Useful for metric separation if you have multiple jobs within same service
- `buckets` (array, optional): For histograms, the bucket boundaries.
- `percentiles` (array, optional): For summaries, the percentiles to calculate.
- `serviceName` (string, optional): If set, the metric is only registered for the given service.

## Metric Types

- **Counter**: Monotonically increasing value (e.g., number of requests).
- **Gauge**: Value that can go up or down (e.g., current memory usage).
- **Histogram**: Measures the distribution of values (e.g., request durations).
- **Summary**: Similar to histogram, but calculates configurable quantiles.

## Using Metrics

Once registered, metrics can be used via the monitor instance:

```js
const monitor = MonitorManager.setup({ serviceName: 'my-service' });

monitor.increment('tasks_created', 1, { provisionerId: 'misc', workerType: 'large' });

monitor.set('current_workers', 5, { provisionerId: 'misc', workerType: 'large' });

monitor.observe('request_duration', 1.23, { endpoint: '/api/do-thing' });
```

## Labels

Labels allow you to partition metric data by dimensions such as worker type, endpoint, or status. When using a metric, provide label values as an object.

## Prometheus Integration

Metrics are exposed in a Prometheus-compatible format. Prometheus can scrape the `/metrics` endpoint to collect and store these values for querying and alerting.

In order for metrics to be exposed, the service must be configured with a `PROMETHEUS_CONFIG` environment variable, for example:

```
PROMETHEUS_CONFIG={"server": {"ip": "0.0.0.0", "port": 9100 }}
```

This specifies the IP address and port where the `/metrics` endpoint will be available for Prometheus to scrape.

## Reference Documentation

The [reference documentation](/docs/reference) defines the metrics output by each service and the meaning assigned to their labels and values.
