Taskcluster permissions are represented by "scopes", covered in more detail in
[the design section](/docs/manual/design/apis/hawk/scopes). For this section, it
is enough to know that a scope is a permission to perform a particular action.

A task has a set of scopes that determine what the task can do.  These scopes
are validated by the worker.  For example, a worker may limit access to
features based on whether the running task has a corresponding scope. It is
also possible for a task to make arbitrary API calls using its scopes via an
authenticating proxy.

Taskcluster avoids "scope escalation", where a user might gain use of scopes
they do not have, by requiring that the creator of a task have all of the
scopes associated with the task. Thus a task's scopes must be satisfied by the
scopes its creator has.

In fact, several scope sets must be satisfieid to create a task:
 * Scopes to create a task for the given worker type
 * Scopes corresponding to some components of the task definition, such as
   routes, priorities, and `schedulerId`.
 * The task's `scopes` property

*NOTE*: this means that scopes for a task must often be configured in two places.  For example, to use a scope `secrets:get:org-project-test-creds`, a task associated with a github project would need:
 * the scope satisfied by a role such as `repo:github.com/org/project:branch:master`
 * the same scope listed in the task's `scopes` property
