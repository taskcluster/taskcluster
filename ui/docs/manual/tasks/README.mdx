This chapter focuses on Taskcluster's core concept: tasks.

At the highest level, Taskcluster executes tasks. New tasks are added to one of
several queues, and workers consume tasks from those queues and execute them.
In the process, services send [Pulse](/docs/manual/design/apis/pulse) messages
about task status, and attach the results of the task -- including logs and
output artifacts -- to the task itself.

A task is described by a task definition, which is a simple data structure
usually encoded in JSON or YAML.  Each task has a unique `taskId`, assigned
randomly by the caller when the task is created.  The full schema for the task
definition is given in [the reference
documentation](/docs/reference/platform/queue/task-schema), but a
simple task might look like this:

```yaml
provisionerId:      aws-provisioner-v1
workerType:         tutorial
created:            2020-01-04T04:18.084Z
deadline:           2020-01-05T04:18.084Z
metadata:
  name:             Example Task
  description:      Eample from TC Manual
  owner:            nobody@taskcluster.net
  source:           https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-docs
payload:
  image:            ubuntu:16.04
  command:          ['echo', 'hello world']
```

You can use the Task Creator tool in the user interface to experiment with
creating tasks.

The next few sections describe the many powerful features of tasks, while the
[next chapter](/docs/manual/task-execution) covers their execution by workers.
