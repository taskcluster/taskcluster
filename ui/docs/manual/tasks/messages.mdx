The Taskcluster Queue service publishes pulse messages when tasks change state.
[Pulse](/docs/manual/design/apis/pulse) is a message bus with a publish /
subscribe model.  These messages are sent by default with a route containing
several of the task's ID's, but can be "copied" (using the AMQP `Cc` header) to
arbitrary routes listed in the task's `routes` property.

This provides a powerful extension point for integrations with Taskcluster.
Taskcluster itself includes a few such integrations:

* The Index service listens for messages about task completion on routes
  beginning with `index`, storing the relevant taskIds for later retrieval.
  [More information..](/docs/reference/core/index)

* The Notify service listens for messages beginning with `notify` and
  translates them into user notifications via email or irc.  [More
  information..](/docs/reference/core/notify)
