# Manipulating Tasks

For the most part, once a task is created it is left to run to its final
resolution. However, there are a few API methods available to modify its
behavior after creation.

Permission for these methods is based on the task's `schedulerId`.

## Force Scheduling

A task which has unfinished dependencies is considered "unscheduled", and not yet
"pending". A scheduled task that depends on itself will remain in that state
until its deadline, unless it is *force-scheduled* with the Queue service's
`scheduleTask` method.  This moves the task into the "pending" state, allowing
workers to claim it.

This method can also be used on tasks which depend on other tasks that are
failed or unfinished.

## Cancelling

A task that is not yet complete can be cancelled. This is generally a
best-effort operation, useful for saving resources. Task execution may continue
for some time after an active task is cancelled, until the worker performing
the task attempts to reclaim it.
