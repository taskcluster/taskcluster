Each task is assigned to a task group by its `taskGroupId`, a random string
specified at task creation. Task groups associate "related" tasks, such as
those created in response to the same version-control push.  In most cases, all
of the tasks in a task group are linked by dependency relations, so it is
common to refer to a task group as a "task graph".  The Queue service provides
an API method to list all tasks with a specific `taskGroupId`, and task
manipulation can be limited by `taskGroupId`.

Tasks also have a `schedulerId`. All tasks in a task group must have the same
`schedulerId`. This is used for several purposes:

 * it can represent the entity that created the task;

 * it can limit addition of new tasks to a task group: the caller of
   `createTask` must have a scope related to the `schedulerId` of the task
   group (more about scopes later); and

 * it controls who can [manipulate tasks](manipulating), again by requiring
   `schedulerId`-related scopes.
