Workers execute tasks, but there are many types of workers. A task specifies a
single "worker type" by which it should be executed, using the two-part
namespace `<provisionerId>/<workerType>`.  The naming of the identifiers can be
a bit confusing: when we refer to a worker type, it is to the combination of
both identifiers. Thus `gcp-provisioner/persona-build` and
`rackspace-provisioner/persona-build` are completely different worker types,
despite sharing the same `workerType` identifier.

*NOTE*: [RFC#145](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pull/145) addresses this confusion by introducing the term `taskQueueId` to name the queue in which a task is stored.
This RFC is not yet fully implemented, so the Queue API still uses identifiers `provisionerId` and `workerType`.

Workers of the same worker type all consume tasks from a single queue, as
[described later](/docs/manual/task-execution/queues), and as such are
interchangeable and have identical configurations.

The format of a task's `payload` property is specific to the worker that will
execute it, so defining a task requires knowledge of worker type's
configuration. If given a task with an inappropriate payload, a worker will
resolve the task with the reason `malformed-payload`.
