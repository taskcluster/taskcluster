import Warning from 'taskcluster-ui/views/Documentation/components/Warning';

Workers execute tasks, but there are many types of workers. A task specifies a
single "task queue" to which it should be added.

<Warning>
[RFC#145](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pull/145) introduced the term `taskQueueId`.
Prior to Taskcluster version 41, this was referred to as `provisionerId`/`workerType`, and those names, while deprecated, still appear in historical tasks.
</Warning>

Workers of the same worker type all consume tasks from a single queue, as
[described later](/docs/manual/task-execution/queues), and as such are
interchangeable and have identical configurations.

The format of a task's `payload` property is specific to the worker that will
execute it, so defining a task requires knowledge of worker type's
configuration. If given a task with an inappropriate payload, a worker will
resolve the task with the reason `malformed-payload`.
