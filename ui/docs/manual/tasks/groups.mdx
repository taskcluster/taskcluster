# Task Groups

Task Groups are a way to group tasks together based on their `taskGroupId`.
When multiple tasks are being created at once, they often have the same `taskGroupId`.
This is useful in situations such as when tasks are created for a Github
push event with a [decision task](/docs/manual/design/conventions/decision-task).

Tasks from the same Task Group might have different `projectIds`.

## Sealing Task Gropus

Sometimes, it may be necessary to block the entire task group from accepting new tasks.
For example, if multiple push events occur on the same branch in Github
and create separate task groups, we can stop previous runs and seal the entire
task group to prevent currently running decision tasks from adding new ones.
This can help to save resources.

To seal a task group, you can use the `queue.sealTaskGroup` method.
Once a task group is sealed, it will no longer accept new tasks and will throw
an error if new task is being added to it.
