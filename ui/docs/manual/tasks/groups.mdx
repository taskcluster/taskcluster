# Task Groups

Task Groups are a way to group tasks together based on their `taskGroupId`.
When multiple tasks are created simultaneously, they often have the same `taskGroupId`.
This is useful in situations where tasks are created for a Github
push event with a [decision task](/docs/manual/design/conventions/decision-task).

In most cases, all of the tasks in a task group are linked by dependency relations,
so it is common to refer to a task group as a "task graph".
The Queue service provides an API method to list all tasks with a specific `taskGroupId`,
and task manipulation can be limited by `taskGroupId`.

Tasks also have a `schedulerId`. All tasks in a task group must have the same
`schedulerId`. This is used for several purposes:

 * it can represent the entity that created the task;

 * it can limit addition of new tasks to a task group: the caller of
   `createTask` must have a scope related to the `schedulerId` of the task
   group (more about scopes later); and

 * it can control who can [manipulate tasks](manipulating), again by requiring
   `schedulerId`-related scopes, although this is more easily accomplished
   with `projectId`.


## Sealing Task Gropus

Sometimes, it may be necessary to block the entire task group from accepting new tasks.
For example, if multiple push events occur on the same branch in Github
and create separate task groups, we can stop previous runs and seal the entire
task group to prevent currently running decision tasks from adding new ones.
This can help to save resources.

To seal a task group, you can use the `queue.sealTaskGroup` method.
Once a task group is sealed, it will no longer accept new tasks and will throw
an error if new task is being added to it.


## Cancelling Task Groups

To cancel all tasks within a single task group, utilize the queue.cancelTaskGroup method.
This method cancels all tasks that are yet to be resolved,
while tasks that have already expired will remain unchanged.
It is important to note that this operation is only possible once the task group
has been sealed by calling the `queue.sealTaskGroup` method

It is safe to call this endpoint multiple times, and each call will only cancel
tasks that have not already been canceled.
While new tasks cannot be added after the task group has been sealed,
existing tasks may be rerun if required.
