title: Dependencies and Task Graphs

Tasks can be linked together such that a dependent task does not start until
its prerequisites are complete. This functionality enables the creation of
"task graphs" containing multi-task dependency chains. For example, a task
graph to build and test an application might start with a set of library build
tasks (one for each platform), followed by application build tasks depending on
those library builds, and culminating in test tasks that depend on the
application build tasks.

Dependencies are defined by listing prerequisite taskIds in the `dependencies`
property of each task. When a new task is submitted to the Queue service, any
tasks listed as a dependency must have already been submitted to the Queue
service. The `requires` task property controls whether the dependent task
should execute if any of its prerequisites fail.

A task can depend on itself -- this is called a "self-dependency". Such a task
will not run automatically, but can be force-scheduled as described in
[Manipulating Tasks](manipulating).
