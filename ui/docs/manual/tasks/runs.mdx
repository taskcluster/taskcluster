A task definition is, in a sense, the input to task execution. The output comes
in the form of "runs" and associated "artifacts".

A run is an attempt to execute a task. Most tasks have a single run, but in
cases where transient errors such loss of a compute node cause a run to fail,
Taskcluster automatically adds additional runs.

Runs are identified by their `runId`, a small integer. While for most tasks,
the single `runId` is `0`, you should always use the latest run to avoid
reading information about a run that failed.

Each run has properties describing the worker that claimed the run (referenced
by the two-part namespace `<workerGroup>/<workerId>`), the reason the run was
created, its current status, and various timestamps.

A run is in one of a few states:

 * `pending` - ready to be claimed and executed
 * `running` - currently executing
 * `completed` - finished successfully
 * `failed` - finished unsuccessfully
 * `exception` - finished due to some reason unrelated to the outcome of task
   execution

Exceptions for infrastructural reasons (for example, loss of a worker) will
result in an automatic re-run if there are sufficient retries left for the
task. Task cancellation and a few other unusual circumstances are also
represented by the `exception` state, and distinguished by the `reason` field
in the task status -- see the [queue API
reference](/docs/reference/platform/queue/api) for details.

A task's state is based on the state of its latest run, with the addition of an
`unscheduled` state for a task with no runs (as is the case when the task's
dependencies are not complete).
