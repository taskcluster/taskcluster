# Taskcluster Manual

## What does Taskcluster do?

Fundamentally, it executes *tasks*. A task is defined in a JSON object, and
placed on a *queue*. A *worker* later claims that task, executes it, and
updates the task with the results.

## What is Taskcluster?

Taskcluster is a set of microservices exposing a REST API, together with a convenient user interface and a set of workers that are responsible for executing tasks.
A *deployment* of Taskcluster consists of running services associated workers (or configuration to start workers on-demand).

## Working with Taskcluster

Most people do not need to understand everything about Taskcluster! The
[Taskcluster Tutorial](/docs/tutorial) is designed to lead newcomers to the information
that is most relevant to them.

The [reference section](/docs/reference) contains documentation about the
Taskcluster services and libraries. Once you have determined the services you
need to interface with, this section can provide all of the technical detail
you need to do so successfully.  The reference section begins with a [guide to
the microservices](/docs/reference/guide) that can help to determine the services
most relevant to your work.

The remainder of the manual describes the Taskcluster platform in depth.  The
[Tasks chapter](/docs/manual/tasks) describes the concept around which the system
revolves -- tasks.  The [Task Execution chapter](/docs/manual/task-execution)
describes how these tasks are executed.  The next chapter, [System
Design](/docs/manual/system-design), provides the details you will need to interact
with Taskcluster. Finally, [Using Taskcluster](/docs/manual/using) presents a
collection of common use cases and approaches to satisfy them.
