# Workers

Workers are the component responsible for actually executing tasks. Taskcluster
operates on the "pull" model, where workers pull tasks from queues as they have
available capacity.

Typically workers are implemented as daemons running on compute instances in
the cloud. As such, they have no REST API -- that is, there is no "worker
service".

## Worker Groups and Ids

Each individual worker is identified by a `<workerGroup>/<workerId>` pair.
When a task is executed, the task run information displays these values.  This
information can be useful to identify misbehaving workers by examining the runs
of failed tasks.

You can drill down to a list of currently-running workers, arranged by
provisioner worker type, in the Taskcluster UI.

## Claiming Tasks

Workers signal their availability for new work by calling the Queue's
`claimWork` method. If there is a task available, this method returns its
details and records a "claim" of that task by the calling worker (in fact, the
method can return multiple tasks in cases where a single worker can execute
tasks concurrently). The claim lasts for a short time - a matter of minutes -
and must be renewed (`reclaimTask`) before it expires.  If a claim does expire,
it implies the Queue-worker communication has broken down, and so the Queue
will resolve the task run as exception / claim-expired, and will schedule
another task run so that another worker may claim the task. This will happen up
to a maximum number of reclaims.

In most cases, multiple workers (with the same `workerPoolId`) pull work from
the same queue (with a matching `taskQueueId`), so the worker that executes a
particular task is not known in advance.  In practice, this does not matter, as
all workers with the same `workerPoolId` are typically configured identically,
so that it will not matter which worker executes a particular task. For
example, it is common to use a variety of similar AWS instance types for a
single worker type, allowing the provisioning logic in the worker manager
service to select the most cost-effective option based on current spot prices.

As mentioned previously, the format of the task payload depends on the
implementation of the worker executing the task. It is up to the task author to
know the payload format a particular worker, as identified by its
`workerPoolId`, will expect.

## Bring Your Own Worker

Workers communicate with the Queue API using normal Taskcluster API calling
conventions. It is quite practical (and fun!) to run purpose-specific workers
with a configuration appropriate to that purpose.

Those workers may run one of the worker implementations developed by the
Taskcluster team, or an entirely purpose-specific implementation that uses the
same APIs. For example, [scriptworker](http://scriptworker.readthedocs.io/) was
developed by Mozilla's release engineering to run release-related scripts in a limited,
secure context.

The Taskcluster-provided worker implementations, including their payload formats, are described in:
* [generic-worker](https://github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker/blob/master/README.md)
* [docker-worker](https://github.com/taskcluster/docker-worker/blob/master/README.md)

The protocol for interacting with the Queue service is described in
[Queue-Worker
Interaction](/docs/reference/platform/queue/worker-interaction).

## Worker Scopes

The Queue APIs used by workers require Taskcluster credentials specific to the
worker pool and worker ID. This prevents a worker from claiming tasks from other
worker types or from misrepresenting its identity.

When a worker claims a task, it gets a set of temporary credentials based on
the task's `scopes` property.
