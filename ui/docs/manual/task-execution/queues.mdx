The [queue service](/docs/reference/platform/queue) is the centralized
coordinator that is responsible for accepting tasks, managing their state, and
assigning them to workers that claim them. It also manages the artifacts and
runs attached to tasks.

The queue service maintains the task queues, each with a `taskQueueId`.
([RFC#145](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pull/145) introduces
this terminology, but many parts of the API still use names having the form
`<provisionerId>/<workerType>`) Tasks are handled in FIFO order (except for
tasks of different priority), so that tasks added earliest will be executed
first.

A dependent task is not available to be claimed by workers until all of the
tasks it depends on have completed. Task deadlines ensure that no task remains
in enqueued forever: the task is resolved when the deadline has passed, whether
it has been executed or not.

When resources permit, the queue prefers to keep queues empty by executing all tasks
immediately when they are submitted to the queue. Thus the focus is on starting new tasks
quickly, rather than optimizing behavior with long queues of pending tasks.
Resources, of course, do not always permit.

The Taskcluster Queue does _not_ require any configuration or programmatic
changes in order to start supporting a new worker. A queue is created
implicitly for any new `taskQueueId` specified in a task.  Similarly, any
worker with scopes to claim tasks from such a queue can do so.  This means no
Queue downtime for the roll out of a new worker -- you can hook your toaster up
to Taskcluster, as long as it has the right scopes. It also means one-off
workers can be written for one-off jobs, if required.
