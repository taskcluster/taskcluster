# Provisioning

In the simplest case, a worker implementation is installed and configured
manually on a host and executes tasks indefinitely. For most purposes, it is
far more cost-effective to dynamically adjust the pool of available workers
based on the work to be done. This process entails both provisioning new
instances (often referred to simply as "provisioning") and terminating running
instances (typically a function of the worker itself).

The worker-manager service is responsible for provisioning and for monitoring the status of running workers.

It operates by monitoring the queues for each worker type.  Based on the queue
length and the configuration of the worker type, it may create new workers when
required.  In future, worker-manager might take into account additional
information to make better predictions of future load. A worker type's
configuration can balance performance (many instances to execute tasks in
parallel) against cost (from idle workers).

## Worker Pool IDs (and Provisioner IDs and Worker Types)

[RFC#145](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/pull/145) introduces the term `workerPoolId` to name a pool of workers.
Historically, this has been referred to by the combination `<provisionerId>/<workerType>`, and these terms are still used in some parts of the Taskcluster API.
Typically, workers in a given worker pool claim tasks from a queue with `taskQueueId` equal to the pool's `workerPoolId`.

The current set of worker pools is visible in the Taskcluster UI.
