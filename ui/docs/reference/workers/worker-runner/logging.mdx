# Logging

{/* LOGGING BEGIN */}
Worker-Runner supports plugins to send log messages (both from worker-runner itself and from the worker)
To various destinations for aggregation.  This is configured with the `logging` property in the runner config,
with the `implementation` property of that object specifying the plugin to use.  Allowed values are:

## stdio

The "stdio" logging logs to stderr with a timestamp prefix.  It is the default
if no logging configuration is given.  It does not take any other properties.

```yaml
logging:
	implementation: stdio
```

{/* LOGGING END */}
