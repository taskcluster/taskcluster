# Workers

<!-- WORKERS BEGIN -->
Information about the worker to run is given in the `worker` property of the runner configuration.
The `implementation` property of this object defines the worker implemenatation.  Allowed values
are:

## docker-worker

The "docker-worker" worker implementation starts docker-worker
(https://github.com/taskcluster/docker-worker).  It takes the following
values in the 'worker' section of the runner configuration:

```yaml
worker:
    implementation: docker-worker
    # path to the 'docker-worker' directory from the docker-worker release tarball
    path: /path/to/docker-worker
    # path where worker-runner should write the generated
    # docker-worker configuration.
    configPath: ..
```

## dummy

The "dummy" worker implementation does nothing but dump the state instead of
"starting" anything.  It is intended for debugging.

```yaml
worker:
    implementation: dummy
```

## generic-worker

The "generic-worker" worker implementation starts generic-worker
(https://github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker).  It takes the following
values in the 'worker' section of the runner configuration:

```yaml
worker:
	implementation: generic-worker
	# path to the root of the generic-worker executable
	# can also be a wrapper script to which args will be passed
	path: /usr/local/bin/generic-worker
	# (Windows only) service name to start
	service: "Generic Worker"
	# (Windows only) named pipe (\\.\pipe\<something>) with which generic-worker
	# will communicate with worker-runner; default value is as shown here:
	protocolPipe: \\.\pipe\generic-worker
	# path where worker-runner should write the generated
	# generic-worker configuration.
	configPath: /etc/taskcluster/generic-worker/config.yaml
```

Specify either 'path' to run the executable directly, or 'service' to name a
Windows service that will run the worker.  In the latter case, the configPath
must match the path configured within the service definition.  See
[windows-services](./docs/windows-services.md) for details.  Note that running
as a service requires at least generic-worker v16.6.0.
