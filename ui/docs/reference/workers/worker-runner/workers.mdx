# Workers

{/* WORKERS BEGIN */}

Information about the worker to run is given in the `worker` property of the runner configuration.
The `implementation` property of this object defines the worker implemenatation. Allowed values
are:

## docker-worker

The "docker-worker" worker implementation starts docker-worker
(https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/main/workers/docker-worker). It takes the following
values in the 'worker' section of the runner configuration:

```yaml
worker:
    implementation: docker-worker
    # path to the 'docker-worker' directory from the docker-worker release tarball
    path: /path/to/docker-worker
    # path where worker-runner should write the generated
    # docker-worker configuration.
    configPath: ..
```

## dummy

The "dummy" worker implementation does nothing but dump the state instead of
"starting" anything. It is intended for debugging.

```yaml
worker:
    implementation: dummy
```

## generic-worker

The "generic-worker" worker implementation starts generic-worker
(https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/workers/generic-worker). It takes the following
values in the 'worker' section of the runner configuration:

```yaml
worker:
	implementation: generic-worker
	# path to the root of the generic-worker executable
	# can also be a wrapper script to which args will be passed
	path: /usr/local/bin/generic-worker
	# (Windows only) service name to start
	service: "Generic Worker"
	# (Windows only) named pipe (\\.\pipe\<something>) with which generic-worker
	# will communicate with worker-runner; default value is as shown here:
	protocolPipe: \\.\pipe\generic-worker
	# path where worker-runner should write the generated
	# generic-worker configuration.
	configPath: /etc/taskcluster/generic-worker/config.yaml
```

On Linux, specify only `implementation`, `path`, and `configPath`.

On Windows, worker-runner can start generic-worker in two ways: as a service, or as a child process.

To run generic-worker as a service, specify `implementation`, `service` and `configPath`, and ensure that the `configPath` matches the `--config` path configured within the service definition.
See [Deployment](/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner/deployment).
In most cases, `protocolPipe` can be omitted to use the default value.
This would only need to be overridden if multiple copies of generic-worker are running on the same host.

To run generic-worker as a child process, specify `implementation`, `path` and `configPath`.
In this case, `protocolPipe` is not used.
