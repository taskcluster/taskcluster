# Built-In Workers Service

This service implements the `built-in/succeed` and `built-in/fail` worker pools, which simply succeed or fail immediately.
Such worker pools are useful the same way the `true` and `false` commands are useful in UNIX.
For example, sometimes when testing a large combination of tasks, it's helpful to replace a task that's not relevant to your work with `built-in/succeed` to avoid wasting time and energy running that task.

## Usage

To use this service, create a task with

```yaml
taskQueueId: built-in/succeed
payload: {}
```

Note that the names end in an imperative-mood verb ("succeed" and "fail").

That's it!
When the task executes (which may not be immediately, for example if it has dependencies), it will resolve immediately as successful or failed.
All other queue functionality is available as usual, routes and dependencies being the most useful features.
