# Installing Generic-Worker

The following instructions should be considered more as a guide rather than
concrete requirements. They document _possible_ (and simple) ways to install
and run generic-worker on various platforms. Real world production deployments
may be performed differently.

## Option 1: Obtain prebuilt release

* Download the latest release for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases
* Download the latest release of taskcluster-proxy for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases
* Download the latest release of livelog for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases
* Download the latest release of start-worker for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases
* For darwin/linux, make the binaries executable: `chmod a+x {generic-worker,livelog,taskcluster-proxy,start-worker}*`

## Option 2: Build from source

If you prefer to build from source:

* Download the required go compiler from https://golang.org/dl/ and follow the
  instructions for your platform. __NOTE: The go compiler version required is
  given in
  https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/blob/main/dev-docs/development-process.md#go__.
* Clone taskcluster monorepo: `git clone github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster`
* Change directory into the tools subdirectory: `cd taskcluster/tools`
* Build livelog, taskcluster-proxy and start-worker: `go install ./...`
  This should place the binaries inside directory `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.
* Change directory to the generic-worker subdirectory of the monorepo: `cd ../workers/generic-worker`
* Run `./build.sh` to check go version, generate code, build binaries, compile
  (but not run) tests, perform linting, and ensure there are no ineffective
  assignments in go code.

  `./build.sh` takes optional arguments, `-a` to build all platforms, and `-t`
  to run tests. By default tests are not run and only the current platform is
  built.

  All being well, the generic-worker binary/binaries will be built in the
  current directory.

## Installation on worker machines

### Windows - multiuser build

 1. Build or download a `generic-worker.exe` windows multiuser binary (see above).

 2. Run the following command to generate an ed25519 private key for signing
    artifacts:

    * `generic-worker.exe new-ed25519-keypair --file C:\generic-worker\ed25519_key`

    The private key will be written to the file `C:\generic-worker\ed25519_key`,
    and the public key will be written to standard out. Keep a copy of the
    public key if you wish to validate artifact signatures.

 3. Download NSSM 2.24 from https://nssm.cc/release/nssm-2.24.zip and extract it
    under `C:\`.

 4. Download livelog from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and
    place it in `C:\generic-worker\livelog.exe`.

 5. Download taskcluster-proxy from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and place it in
    `C:\generic-worker\taskcluster-proxy.exe`.

 6. Download start-worker from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and place it in
    `C:\generic-worker\start-worker.exe`.

 7. Create `C:\generic-worker\generic-worker.config` with appopriate values.

 8. Edit file `C:\generic-worker\generic-worker.config` with appropriate
    settings (see `generic-worker.exe --help` for information).

 9. Reboot the machine, and the worker should be running. Check logs under
    `C:\generic-worker\generic-worker.log`.


### macOS - multiuser/simple build

__These instructions require macOS Mojave version 10.14.x__

 1. Log into target user account:

    __Simple build__: Create user account `genericworker` to run the worker
	under, and log in as `genericworker` in a shell.

    __Multiuser build__: Log in as _root_ (`sudo su -`) in a shell.

 2. __Multiuser build only__

    Disable wizards/warning pop ups on first-login to user accounts:

    * `git clone git@github.com:rtrouton/profiles.git`
    * `git -C profiles checkout f23bc6146ca570108dbaa9e3cb8da954ce325002` (just because this is the version I tested, later versions may also be fine)
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipSiriSetup/SkipSiriSetup.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipDarkorLightAppearance/SkipDarkorLightAppearance.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/Disable32BitApplicationWarning/10.14/Disable32BitApplicationWarning.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipDataAndPrivacy/SkipDataAndPrivacy.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipiCloudSetup/SkipiCloudSetup.mobileconfig`

 3. Download `generic-worker` from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and place it in
    `/usr/local/bin/generic-worker`.

 4. Download livelog from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and
    place it in `/usr/local/bin/livelog`.

 5. Download taskcluster-proxy from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and place it in
    `/usr/local/bin/taskcluster-proxy`.

 6. Download start-worker from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/ and place it in
    `/usr/local/bin/start-worker`.

 7. Make `generic-worker`, `taskcluster-proxy`, `livelog`, `start-worker` binaries executable:

    * `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/{generic-worker,taskcluster-proxy,livelog,start-worker}`

 8. Generate a key for signing artifacts:

    * `sudo mkdir /etc/generic-worker`

    * __Simple build only__: `sudo chown genericworker:staff /etc/generic-worker`

    * `/usr/local/bin/generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair --file /etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key`

    The private key will be written to the file
    `/etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key`, and the public key will be written to
    standard out. Keep a copy of the public key if you wish to validate artifact
    signatures.

 9. Create the file `/usr/local/bin/run-generic-worker.sh` with the following content:

    ```
    #!/bin/bash

    . /etc/rc.common

    CheckForNetwork

    while [ "${NETWORKUP}" != "-YES-" ]
    do
      sleep 5
      NETWORKUP=
      CheckForNetwork
    done

    /usr/local/bin/generic-worker run --config /etc/generic-worker/config
    ```

10. Run the following to make the `run-generic-worker.sh` script executable:

    * `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/run-generic-worker.sh`

10. Create `/etc/generic-worker/config` with appropriate configuration settings
    (see `generic-worker --help` for details). Something like this:

    ```
    {
      "accessToken": "********************************************",
      "cachesDir": "/Library/Caches/generic-worker/caches",
      "cleanUpTaskDirs": true,
      "clientId": "project/foo/bar/my/client",
      "disableReboots": false,
      "downloadsDir": "/Library/Caches/generic-worker/downloads",
      "ed25519SigningKeyLocation": "/etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key",
      "workerPoolId": "my/worker-pool",
      "publicIP": "1.2.3.4",
      "requiredDiskSpaceMegabytes": 2048,
      "rootURL": "https://my-root-url.com",
      "sentryProject": "generic-worker",
      "shutdownMachineOnIdle": false,
      "shutdownMachineOnInternalError": false,
      "subdomain": "taskcluster-worker.net",
      "taskclusterProxyPort": 8080,
      "tasksDir": "/Users",
      "workerGroup": "my-worker-group",
      "workerId": "my-lovely-computer",
      "wstAudience": "taskcluster-net",
      "wstServerURL": "https://websocktunnel.tasks.build"
    }
    ```

11. Create launch daemon:

    Create the file `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mozilla.genericworker.plist`
    with the following content:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>Label</key>
            <string>com.mozilla.genericworker</string>
            <key>Program</key>
            <string>/usr/local/bin/run-generic-worker.sh</string>
            <key>StandardOutPath</key>
            <string>/var/log/genericworker/stdout.log</string>
            <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
            <string>/var/log/genericworker/stderr.log</string>
            <key>RunAtLoad</key>
            <true/>
            <key>UserName</key>
            <string>root</string> <----------- (for multiuser build)
            <string>genericworker</string> <----------- (for simple build)
        </dict>
    </plist>
    ```

12. Install launch daemon:

    * `sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mozilla.genericworker.plist`

13. Watch for logs in `/var/log/generic-worker/`.


### Linux simple/multiuser/docker build

 1. Make sure your system is up-to-date. For example, on ubuntu:

    ```
    apt update
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -yq
    ```

 2. Install curl (needed for later). For example, on ubuntu:

    ```
    apt install -y curl
    ```

 3. For _multiuser_ ensure Gnome Desktop 3 is installed:

    ```
    apt install -y ubuntu-desktop ubuntu-gnome-desktop
    ```

 4. For _docker_ engine, _or_ if tasks require Docker, install it. For example,
	on ubuntu bionic:

    ```
    apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
    add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
    apt update
    apt-cache policy docker-ce | grep -qF download.docker.com
    apt install -y docker-ce
    sleep 5
    systemctl status docker | grep "Started Docker Application Container Engine"
    usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    ```

 5. Download `generic-worker`, `taskcluster-proxy` and `livelog` to `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```
    cd /usr/local/bin
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/download/v44/generic-multiuser-linux-amd64" > generic-worker
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/download/v44/livelog-linux-amd64" > livelog
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/download/v44/taskcluster-proxy-linux-amd64" > taskcluster-proxy
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/releases/download/v44/start-worker-linux-amd64" > start-worker
    ```

 6. Make binaries executable:

    ```
    chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/{generic-worker,taskcluster-proxy,livelog,start-worker}
    ```

 7. Create directories required by generic-worker:

    ```
    mkdir -p /etc/generic-worker /var/local/generic-worker
    ```

 8. Check generic-worker works and has correct version:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/generic-worker --version
    ```

 9. Generate a key for signing artifacts:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair --file /etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key
    ```

    The private key will be written to the file
    `/etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key`, and the public key will be written to
    standard out. Keep a copy of the public key if you wish to validate artifact
    signatures.

10. Ensure host 'taskcluster' resolves to localhost:

    ```
    echo 127.0.1.1 taskcluster >> /etc/hosts
    ```

11. __AWS workers only__: configure generic-worker to run on boot with
	dynamically provided config from AWS Provisioner:

    ```
    echo '@reboot cd /var/local/generic-worker && PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin /usr/local/bin/generic-worker run --configure-for-aws --config /etc/generic-worker/config >> /var/log/generic-worker.log 2>&1' | crontab -
    ```

	Make sure netplan network renderer takes precendence over eni network
	renderer. See [bug 1499054 comment
    12](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499054#c12) for an
    explanation.

    ```
    cat > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/01_network_renderer_policy.cfg << EOF
    system_info:
        network:
          renderers: [ 'netplan', 'eni', 'sysconfig' ]
    EOF
    ```

12. __Non-AWS workers only__: configure generic-worker to run on boot with
	a static local config file:

    ```
    echo '@reboot cd /var/local/generic-worker && PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin /usr/local/bin/generic-worker run --config /etc/generic-worker/config >> /var/log/generic-worker.log 2>&1' | crontab -
    ```

    Create `/etc/generic-worker/config` with appropriate configuration settings
    (see `generic-worker --help` for details).


## Acquire taskcluster credentials for running tests

There are two alternative mechanisms to acquire the scopes you need.

### Option 1

This method works if you log into Taskcluster via mozillians, *or* you log into
taskcluster via LDAP *using the same email address as your mozillians account*,
*or* if you do not currently have a mozillians account but would like to create
one.

* Sign up for a [Mozillians account](https://mozillians.org/en-US/) (if you do not already have one)
* Request membership of the [taskcluster-contributors](https://mozillians.org/en-US/group/taskcluster-contributors/) mozillians group

### Option 2

This method is for those who wish not to create a mozillians account, but
already authenticate into taskcluster via some other means, or have a
mozillians account but it is registered to a different email address than the
one they use to log into Taskcluster with (e.g. via LDAP integration).

* Request the scope `assume:project:taskcluster:generic-worker-tester` to be
  granted to you via a [bugzilla
  request](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Taskcluster&component=Service%20Request),
  including your [currently active `ClientId`](https://tools.taskcluster.net/credentials/)
  in the bug description. From the ClientId, we will be able to work out which role to assign the scope
  to, in order that you acquire the scope with the client you log into Taskcluster tools site with.

Once you have been granted the above scope:

* If you are signed into tools.taskcluster.net already, **sign out**
* Sign into [tools.taskcluster.net](https://tools.taskcluster.net/) using either your new Mozillians account, _or_ your LDAP account **if it uses the same email address as your Mozillians account**
* Check that a role or client of yours appears in [this list](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/scopes/assume%3Aproject%3Ataskcluster%3Ageneric-worker-tester)
* Create a permanent client (taskcluster credentials) for yourself in the [Client Manager](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/clients/) granting it the single scope `assume:project:taskcluster:generic-worker-tester`

## Set up your env

* Generate an ed25519 key pair with `generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair --file <file>` where `file` is where you want the generated ed25519 private key to be written to
* Create a generic worker configuration file somewhere, with the following content:

```
{
    "accessToken":                "<access token of your permanent credentials>",
    "certificate":                "",
    "clientId":                   "<client ID of your permanent credentials>",
    "ed25519SigningKeyLocation":  "<file location you wrote ed25519 private key to>",
    "livelogSecret":              "<anything you like>",
    "workerPoolId":               "test/worker-pool",
    "publicIP":                   "<ideally an IP address of one of your network interfaces>",
    "workerGroup":                "test-worker-group",
    "workerId":                   "test-worker-id",
}
```

To see a full description of all the config options available to you, run `generic-worker --help`.

## Start the generic worker

Simply run:

```
generic-worker run --config <config file>
```

where `<config file>` is the generic worker config file you created above.

## Create a test job

Go to https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-creator/ and create a task to run on your generic worker.

Use [this example](worker_types/win2012r2/task-definition.json) as a template, but make sure to edit `taskQueueId` values so that they match what you set in your config file.

Don't forget to submit the task by clicking the *Create Task* icon.

If all is well, your local generic worker should pick up the job you submit, run it, and report back status.
