# Support Tiers

While Generic-Worker can run on a wide variety of platforms, the level of support for those platforms varies.
Support levels are categorized into tiers, each bringing a different set of guarantees.
This model is based on [Rust's support tiers](https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html).

## Tier 1

Tier one platforms are "guaranteed to work". That means:

  * They are tested in Taskcluster's continuous integration and tests must pass for a change to land.
  * Binaries are provided with each Taskcluster release.

The Tier-1 platforms are:

  * generic-worker-multiuser-darwin-arm64
  * generic-worker-multiuser-linux-amd64
  * generic-worker-multiuser-windows-amd64
  * generic-worker-simple-linux-amd64

## Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms are "guaranteed to build". That means:

  * They are built (generally cross-compiled) in Taskcluster's continuous integration
  * They may not work
  * Tests are _not_ run automatically
  * Binaries _are_ provided with each Taskcluster release

The Tier-2 platforms are:

  * generic-worker-multiuser-darwin-amd64
  * generic-worker-multiuser-freebsd-amd64
  * generic-worker-multiuser-freebsd-arm64
  * generic-worker-multiuser-linux-arm64
  * generic-worker-multiuser-windows-386
  * generic-worker-simple-darwin-amd64
  * generic-worker-simple-darwin-arm64
  * generic-worker-simple-freebsd-amd64
  * generic-worker-simple-freebsd-arm64
  * generic-worker-simple-linux-arm64
