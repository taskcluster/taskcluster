# Support Tiers

While Generic-Worker can run on a wide variety of platforms, the level of support for those platforms varies.
Support levels are categorized into tiers, each bringing a different set of guarantees.
This model is based on [Rust's support tiers](https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html).

## Tier 1

Tier one platforms are "guaranteed to work".
That means that
* They are tested in Taskcluster's continuous integration and tests must pass for a change to land.
* Binaries are provided with each Taskcluster release.

The Tier-1 platforms are:

* generic-worker-multiuser-darwin-amd64
* generic-worker-multiuser-darwin-arm64
* generic-worker-multiuser-linux-amd64
* generic-worker-multiuser-windows-386
* generic-worker-multiuser-windows-amd64
* generic-worker-simple-darwin-amd64
* generic-worker-simple-darwin-arm64
* generic-worker-simple-linux-amd64

## Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms are "guaranteed to build".
That means that
* The are built (generally cross-compiled) in Taskcluster's continuous integration
* Tests are not run automatically
* Binaries are not provided with each Taskcluster release

* generic-worker-docker-linux-amd64
* generic-worker-simple-linux-arm
* generic-worker-simple-linux-arm64

## Tier 3

Tier 3 platforms are supported, but that support is not at all guaranteed.

The Tier-3 platforms are:

* generic-worker-multiuser-freebsd-amd64
