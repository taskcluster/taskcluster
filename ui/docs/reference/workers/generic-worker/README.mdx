# Generic Worker

Generic-Worker is a worker for Taskcluster, designed to run arbitrary tasks on a wide range of platforms.
While Taskcluster supports many worker implementations as long as they follow the [Queue-Worker interaction process](/docs/reference/platform/queue/worker-interaction), Generic-Worker is the common choice for most worker pools.

This documentation is a work in progress.

## Payload Formats

When submitting a task to the Taskcluster Queue (see [createTask](/docs/reference/platform/queue/api#createTask)) you must provide a payload property for the task.
This `payload` property is specific to the worker implementation, and tells the worker what to execute, and which artifacts to upload.
The worker will run the task, upload artifacts, and report status to the Queue.

The generic-worker expects an imperative payload comprised of commands to run (`command`) and a timeout for the task (`maxRunTime`), with additional optional settings such as artifacts to upload or environment variables to set.

Depending on the operating system of the worker, and the generic-worker engine that has been installed (multiuser or insecure), the exact form of the required payload varies.
Please see the following pages for guidance:

 * [Generic worker payload - multiuser, posix](/docs/reference/workers/generic-worker/multiuser-posix-payload)
 * [Generic worker payload - multiuser, windows](/docs/reference/workers/generic-worker/multiuser-windows-payload)
{/* END PAYLOAD LINKS */}
