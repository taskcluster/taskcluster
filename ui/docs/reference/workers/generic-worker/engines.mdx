# Engines

## Multiuser engine

Generic worker uses the multiuser engine, which provides task isolation by
creating unique OS user accounts for each task that is to be run. Each task
user account (by default) is unprivileged, much like a guest user account.
Once the task has completed, the task user account is purged, and there should
be no further trace of the task on the system. The task user does not have
permission to alter system-wide settings, so after the user account is purged,
the host environment should be restored to a pristine state.

Since the generic-worker process runs under a different user account to the
task processes, taskcluster credentials, signing keys, and other private matter
can be protected from task access. Note, it is the responsibility of the host
owner to lock down resources as necessary, to ensure that an unprivleged
account does not have access to anything private on the machine.

Since tasks run on the host of the worker (without any container technology or
virtualisation technology), toolchains that need to be installed as an
Administrator typically need to be installed on the host environment.
Toolchains that do not require Administrator privileges to be installed can be
installed as task steps.

## Discontinued: Docker engine

The preferred way to run tasks inside a container is for the task to execute
podman/docker commands directly.

Docker Worker payload compatibility in Generic Worker is currently [under
development](https://github.com/orgs/taskcluster/projects/14). It is being
implemented as a translation layer (d2g) inside Generic Worker, that will
internally translate the Docker Worker formatted task payload into an
equivalent Generic Worker payload that invokes docker commands directly.

## Discontinued: Insecure engine

The insecure engine was the original, simplest engine. It executed processes as
child processes of the generic-worker process, under the same user account.
This provided no isolation between tasks and the worker process. It has been
removed in favor of the multiuser engine, which provides proper task isolation.
