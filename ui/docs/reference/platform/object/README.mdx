# Object Service

The object service handles storage of large quantities of data.
It acts as a frontend to various cloud storage services.

## Usage

The object service is used internally by the Queue service, and by workers uploading artifacts.

Usage of the service to download data can use the "simple" download API with nothing more than a robust HTTP client.
