# Download Methods

## Introduction

The Object Service does not directly handle object data.  Instead, it
coordinates data storage on other providers such as public clouds. That makes
downloads a little more complicated than they might otherwise be.

There are two ways to download an object from the service: the "full" process
and the "simple" process.  The "full" process is particular to the object
service, while the "simple" process is "plain HTTP" and works with any HTTP
client.

See ["Simple Downloads"](/simple-downloads) for details of the simple process.

Note that objects are immutable, so downloads may be split into many requests without concern about the content changing between requests.

## Full Downloads

The full download process involves making a request to the object service, via the `object.startDownload` endpoint.
The response to this request contains the information required to download the object data.

Taskcluster will provide libraries to support this interaction.

## Download Methods

The full download process supports negotiation of a "method" by which the download will take place.
This negotiation accomplishes two things:
 * decouples download clients from the object service, allowing new, more advanced methods to be defined while maintaining support for older methods; and
 * allows the use of "unusual" technology when all parties support it -- for example, AWS supports Bittorrent downloads.

The `startDownload` request contains a list of methods that the caller supports.
The object service determines the methods that it can support for the requested object and which are also supported by the client, then chooses the "best" of the matching methods.
The service then calculates a response for that method and returns it to the caller.

The `startDownload` request can contain additional parameters, specific to the chosen method, but those are not considered in the negotiation.
The `acceptDownloadMethods` property in the `startDownload` request contains all supported methods as properties, with their parameters as values.
Methods that do not need parameters simply use `true`.
For example, a request that can use either the `simple` or `superFancy` methods might look like:

```javascript
{
  acceptDownloadMethods: {
    simple: true,
    superFancy: {
      superParam1: 13,
      superParam2: 42,
    },
  }
}
```

The known methods are defined below.
See the API definitions for the object service for details on the request and response payloads.

### `simple` Download Method

The `simple` method is always supported, as it is used to implement [simple downloads](/simple-downloads).
The response contains a URL against which a `GET` request can be made to retrieve the object's data.
This method should only be used by generic clients that are not aware of the particulars of the object service, such as `curl` or web browsers.
Taskcluster-aware clients should use the `getUrl` method, which is always available.

### `getUrl` Download Method

The `getUrl` method is similar to `simple`, but with some slightly different requirements.
Briefly, it returns a URL from which the object data may be downloaded, along with some metadata for validating the result.
This method is always supported.

To use the `getUrl` method with `startDownload`, pass the following payload:

```javascript
acceptDownloadMethods: {
  getUrl: true
}
```

The response contains the following fields:

 * `url` -- the URL from which the object data may be fetched using an HTTP `GET` request.
 * `expires` -- the time after which `url` is no longer available.
 * `hashes` -- a list of hashes for the object data.

The client should begin a GET request as soon as possible after receiving the reponse.
The server will respond with a 200 OK containing the data, or with a 4xx or 5xx error response.
It will _not_ redirect to another URL (3xx), and the client should not follow any such redirects.

The client can use standard Range requests to download portions of the object or to resume an interrupted download.
Per the HTTP standard, servers may return more data than requested by the Range header.

If retrying a failed or interrupted download, and the `expires` field is in the past, the client should call `startDownload` again to get an updated `url`.
The client can assume that the object data and `hashes` will be the same for all calls to `startDownload`.

The client can use standard Accept-Encoding headers to indicate the encodings it can accept.
However, in a deviation from standard HTTP, the client _must_ accept at least `identity` and `gzip` encodings.
If the HTTP response has a `Content-Encoding` header, the client should decode the body before verifying its hashes and returning it to the application.

The client _must_ verify that the resulting data matches the supplied hashes.
The object service does not, itself, validate object data and relies on clients to do so.
