# Upload and Download Methods

## Introduction

The Object Service does not directly upload and download objects, but acts as an
intermediary on behalf of other data storage service providers. To upload an
object, clients must make a request to the Object Service describing the object
to upload (`object.uploadObject`), and the Object Service responds with details
for the client to perform the upload directly.

Similarly, to download an object (`object.downloadObject`), a request must be
made to the Object Service describing the object, and the Object Server responds
with information for the client to download the object directly (typically a
URL).

## Download Methods

Currently the Object Service supports the single download method `HTTP:GET`. In
order to support additional download methods in future, download requests from
clients should include a list of download methods to use, in
the `acceptDownloadMethods` property of the request body and the server will
select the preferred method. When additional download methods are available,
the Object Service will select a preferred download method from the intersection
of its supported download methods and the `acceptDownloadMethods`
of the client request.
