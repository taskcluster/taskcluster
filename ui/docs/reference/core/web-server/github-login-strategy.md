# GitHub Login Strategy

This login strategy is based on GitHub OAuth authentication.

## Identities

Identity strings are of the form `github/<gh_userid>|<gh_username>`.

If a user changes their GitHub username, the identity string will change accordingly.
Since the numeric GitHub `userid` cannot be changed, and no user can impersonate another user by changing username.

## User Scopes

This login strategy currently provides no additional scopes for users.
