# Web Server

The "web-server" service provides the backend for the Taskcluster UI.

## GraphQL

The UI and web-server communicate via GraphQL.
GraphQL requests to the web-server service are translated into REST API calls to other services.
This allows flexible queries from the UI and makes room for optimizations in the backend.

*IMPORTANT*: the GraphQL interface is intended *only* for use by the Taskcluster UI service.
It is not a general-purpose interface to Taskcluster and will change incompatibly and without warning from version to version of the Taskcluster services.
All external integrations with Taskcluster should use the documented REST API.

## User Login

This service provides the backend for secure user authentication using pluggable login strategies.
Each relies on a different upstream identity provider to identify users.

These strategies are used to generate user sessions that are tracked with session cookies.
The Taskcluster UI then uses the `getCredentials` query periodically to fetch fresh Taskcluster credentials corresponding to the signed-in user.
Again, this approach is intended only for use by the Taskcluster UI.

The following login strategies are supported:

* [GitHub](/docs/reference/core/web-server/github-login-strategy)
* [Mozilla-Auth0](/docs/reference/core/web-server/mozilla-auth0-login-strategy)

## Third Party Login

If you are building a web application that will interact with Taskcluster on behalf of your user,
you will need your users' Taskcluster credentials. The [Frontend Integration](/docs/manual/using/integration/frontend)
document contains more information on that topic.

## Identity

Login strategies assign each user an `identity` in the form `<identityProviderId>/<identityId>`.
The `identityProviderId` portion is the name of the login strategy, while the second uniquely identifies the user within that strategy.

## Scopes

Each login strategy defines a way of calculating the scopes afforded to a particular user, based on that user's profile in the user-authentication system on which it relies.
For example, the GitHub login strategy defines scopes according to a user's team membership.
See the documentation linked above for details.

In all cases, a user's scopes include `assume:login-identity:<identity>`.
This role can be modified to grant scopes to a specific user, although best practice is to grant scopes to named groups or teams instead.
[Conventionally](/docs/manual/design/conventions/login-identities), a parameterized role is used to allow all users to create clients.

### Client Scanning

Periodically, a background job in the web-server service scans all clients with names matching `<identityProviderId>/<identity>*` for all users.
These are the clientIds permitted by the [conventional](/docs/manual/design/conventions/login-identities) parameterized role.

For each client, it extracts the identity, verifies the scopes available to that identity, and checks whether those scopes satisfy the client's scopes.
If not, the client is disabled.
This scan ensures that when a user is removed from a team or group, that user cannot make use of previously-created clients with scopes from that team or group.
