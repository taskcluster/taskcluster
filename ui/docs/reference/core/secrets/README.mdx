# Secrets Service

The secrets service provides a simple key/value store for small bits of secret data.
Access is limited by scopes, so values can be considered secret from those who do not have the relevant scopes.

Secrets also have an expiration date, and once a secret has expired it can no longer be read.
This is useful for short-term secrets such as a temporary service credential or a one-time signing key.
Secrets that should never expire are simply given expiration dates in the distant future.

Note that the *existence* of a secret is public information: no scopes are required to list secrets.
Only the content of the secret is protected by scopes.
