# Azure Provider Type

Azure-based providers create workers dynamically in Azure, within a single Resource Group.
Best practice is to use a dedicated resource group for each provider that is not shared with other uses.
This makes it easier to identify which resources a provider is responsible for.

## Provisioning Modes

An Azure launch configuration can use one of two deployment strategies:

- **Sequential resource provisioning** (legacy): worker-manager provisions the public IP, NIC, disks, and VM individually. Launch configurations must describe the VM shape (`hardwareProfile`, `storageProfile`, `subnetId`, etc.) and the provider manages the lifecycle of each resource.
- **ARM template provisioning**: set `armDeployment` on the launch configuration (optionally `armDeploymentResourceGroup`). Worker-manager creates an Azure Deployment and injects required parameters (`adminUsername`, `adminPassword`, `computerName`, `customData`, `vmName`). Once the deployment succeeds it records the created resources so they can be monitored and deprovisioned later, and it deletes the ARM deployment to avoid hitting Azureâ€™s per-resource-group limit.

Use ARM templates when you want Azure Resource Manager to create multiple dependent resources in one operation (for example, when your template handles public IPs, diagnostics accounts, or managed identities). Use sequential provisioning when the existing launch configs already cover your needs or when you want worker-manager to manage each resource directly.

## Removing Workers

A call to the `workerManager.removeWorker` API method for a worker managed by this provider type will result in an attempt to terminate the worker virtual machine and remove related resources.
Worker virtual machines have an associated NIC and public IP address which will also be deleted.
For ARM-template workers, worker-manager also deletes the deployment it created once all resources are cleaned up.

## Worker Interaction

The Azure metadata service [does not currently have a working feature](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/30370) for providing text data to VMs, so while the provider sets a `customData` blob for parity with the other providers, it also provides a set of tags, described below, that are the recommended source of the information a worker requires to start up.

### CustomData

The provider starts workers with an instance attribute named `taskcluster` containing a JSON object with the following properties:

* `workerPoolId` -- worker pool for this worker
* `providerId` -- provider ID that started the worker
* `workerGroup` -- the `location` of the launchConfig used to start the worker
* `rootUrl` -- [root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls) for the Taskcluster deployment
* `workerConfig` -- worker configuration supplied as part of the worker pool configuration (deprecated; use the result of `registerWorker` instead)

The worker's `workerId` is identical to its vmId, which can be retrieved from the Azure metadata service at `compute/vmId`.

### Worker Identity Proof

The `workerIdentityProof` contains a [signed attested data document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service#attested-data) in its `document` property:

```json
{"document": "<signature>"}
```

The document is validated, then checked to ensure it has the same `vmID` as the provisioned worker.

### Tags

The provider creates worker resources with the following labels. The tags `provider-id`, `worker-group`, `worker-pool-id`, and `root-url` are used by the worker for configuration while `customData` is broken in the instance metadata service.

 * `provider-id` - provider ID that started the worker
 * `worker-group` - the worker's workerGroup (currently equal to the providerId, but do not depend on this)
 * `worker-pool-id` - the worker's workerPoolId
 * `root-url` - [root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls) for the Taskcluster deployment
 * `managed-by` - `taskcluster`
 * `created-by` - `taskcluster-wm-<providerId>`
 * `owner` - the worker pool's owner

## Worker-Pool Configuration

Worker-pool configuration for a worker-pool using this provider type must match the following schema.
