# Static Provider Type

The static provider type implements providers that do not dynamically create workers.
This is appropriate for cases where the workers are created outside of the Taskcluster deployment and do not respond to changes in task load.

## Worker Creation

This provider works differently from the cloud-based providers, because it does not create or destroy workers itself.
It relies on users to do so.

Each worker in a worker pool managed by a provider of this type must be created via the `workerManager.createWorker` API method.
Unrecognized workers will not be given Taskcluster credentials.

This method requires a `providerData` field containing a `staticSecret` property.
This property must be a 44-character string, which is most easily created by concatenating two slugid's.
The secret for each worker should be different, to ensure that worker identities are authoritative.

The same secret must be provided by the worker when it calls `registerWorker` to get its credentials.

## Worker Management

An existing worker can be modified with the `updateWorker` API call.
This takes the same arguments as `createWorker`, and allows updating `capacity`, `expires`, and the `providerData.staticSecret`.
This is useful when it's necessary to rotate the static secret, or when the capacity of the worker changes.

An existing worker can be removed with the `removeWorker` API call.
As with other providers, this will not actually remove record of the worker's existence.
Instead, it will mark the worker as STOPPED, in which state it will not be able to renew its worker credentials via `registerWorker`.
Once the worker expires, it will be removed.

## Worker-Pool Configuration

Worker-pool configuration for a worker-pool using this provider type must match the following schema.
