# Worker-Manager - Launch Configurations

Launch configurations define how Worker-Manager should create and manage cloud instances for worker pools.
This feature is supported by the following cloud providers:
- [AWS Provider](/docs/reference/core/worker-manager/aws.mdx)
- [Azure Provider](/docs/reference/core/worker-manager/azure.mdx)
- [Google Provider](/docs/reference/core/worker-manager/google.mdx)

## Configuration

Each launch configuration _may_ include a `workerManager` object that controls how instances are provisioned:

```yaml
workerManager:
  launchConfigId: 'unique-config-id'      # Optional: Unique identifier for this configuration
  capacityPerInstance: 1                  # Number of workers per instance
  initialWeight: 0.5                      # Float between 0 and 1 (default: 1)
  maxCapacity: 100                        # Optional: Maximum number of instances per launch configuration
```

### Properties

- `launchConfigId`: A unique identifier for the launch configuration within a worker pool. If not specified, Worker-Manager generates one automatically. Identical configurations should use the same ID.
- `capacityPerInstance`: Indicates how many concurrent tasks a single instance can handle.
- `initialWeight`: A value between `0` and `1` that determines the likelihood of this configuration being used. A value of `0` effectively disables the configuration.
- `maxCapacity`: Optional hard limit on the number of running instances for this configuration. Falls back to the worker pool's maxCapacity if not specified.

## Improved Provisioning

Worker-Manager implements improved provisioning strategies to:
1. Balance load across launch configurations
2. Respect capacity limits
3. Adapt to failures and errors

### Using initial weight

Initial weight determines how likely a configuration will be selected during provisioning.

#### How It Works
- `Probability = (Config Weight) / (Sum of All Weights)`
- Higher weights increase selection probability

#### Examples

**Two Configurations:**
- Config A: `1.0`, Config B: `0.1`
- Result: `~91%` A, `~9%` B (9 workers on A for each 1 on B)

**Three Configurations:**
- Config A: `1.0`, Config B: `0.5`, Config C: `0.5`
- Result: `~50%` A, `~25%` B, `~25%` C

#### Weight Distribution Playground

#### Use Cases
- Cost optimization: Assign higher weights to cheaper regions
- Fault tolerance: Distribute across regions while favoring more reliable ones
- Performance optimization: Prioritize regions closer to your users
- Capacity management: Use lower weights for regions with limited quota
- Testing: Allocate small weight to new configurations for gradual adoption

### Weight Adjustment

The actual weight used for provisioning is dynamically adjusted based on:
- Current capacity vs maxCapacity
- Recent error rates (within the last hour)

The adjustment follows these rules:

1. **Capacity-based adjustment**:
   ```
   adjustedWeight = initialWeight - (existingCapacity/maxCapacity)
   ```

2. **Error-based adjustment**:
   ```
   adjustedWeight = initialWeight - (configErrors/totalErrors)
   ```

This ensures that:
- Configurations approaching their capacity limit are used less frequently
- Configurations experiencing errors receive reduced priority
- Configurations with persistent failures are temporarily avoided

### Error Recovery

Worker-Manager uses a 1-hour sliding window for error tracking, allowing configurations to automatically recover from temporary issues.
This prevents permanent exclusion while maintaining system reliability.

## Usage Tracking

Worker-Manager maintains a history of launch configurations and their associated workers.
This history is preserved as long as there are active workers created from a configuration.
The `launchConfigId` is included in API responses for workers and errors, enabling detailed tracking and troubleshooting.
