It presents the provisioner/worker\ntype/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,\nthe web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the\nURL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the\nuser operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.\n\nThe level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is\ncalled the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,\nare registered against the provisioner when calling\n`queue.declareProvisioner`.\n\nThe action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web\ninterface to present the action to the user as follows:\n\n| `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |\n|-------------|--------------------------------|\n| provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |\n| worker-type | Workers Explorer               |\n| worker      | Worker Explorer                |\n\nSee [actions docs](/docs/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/actions)\nfor more information.\n",
