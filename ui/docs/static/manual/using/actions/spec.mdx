title: Action Specification
order: 20
---

This document specifies how actions exposed by the *[decision
task](/docs/manual/using/task-graph)* are to be presented and triggered from
Treeherder, or similar user interfaces.

The *decision task* creates an artifact `public/actions.json` to be consumed by
a user interface such as Treeherder. The `public/actions.json` file specifies
the available actions.

Through the `public/actions.json` file it is possible expose actions
defined in-tree such that the actions can be conveniently triggered in
a user interface tool such as Treeherder. This has two purposes:

1.  Facilitate development of utility actions/tools in-tree, and,
2.  Strongly decouple build/test configuration from Treeherder.

For details on how define custom actions in-tree, refer to
the in-tree actions section. This document merely
specifies how `actions.json` shall be interpreted.

## actions.json

The content of `actions.json` is a list of actions and some variables, to be
described later.

Each action has a `kind` describing how a user interface should trigger it.
The kind-specific properties are described later.

### Action Metadata

Each action entry must define a `name`, `title` and `description`.  The order
of the array of actions is significant: actions should be displayed in this
order, and when multiple actions apply, the first takes precedence (see below).

The `name` is used by user interfaces to identify the action. For
example, a retrigger button might look for an action with
name = "retrigger".

Taskcluster UI has default implementations for some actions, but if a decision
task has a better implementation then it can override the default by using the
same action name. The default actions hold the following names and will be
supplied with the described input:

| Action | name | input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schedule Task | `schedule` | `{}` |
| Retrigger Task | `retrigger` | `{}` |
| Cancel Task | `cancel` | `{}` |
| Purge Worker Cache | `purge-cache` | `{}` |
| Create an Interactive Task | `create-interactive` | `{}` |

Action names must be unique for a given task, or for a taskgroup, but
the same name may be used for actions applying to disjoint sets of
tasks. For example, it may be helpful to define different "retrigger"
actions for build tasks \[{jobKind: 'build'}\] and test tasks
\[{jobKind: 'test'}\], and in this case only one such action would apply
to any given task. If multiple actions with the same `name` match a task,
the first action in the array should be used.

The `title` is a human readable string intended to be used as label on
the button, link or menu entry that triggers the action. This should be
short and concise. Ideally, you'll want to avoid duplicates.

The `description` property contains a human readable string describing
the action, such as what it does, how it does it, what it is useful for.
This string is to be rendered as **markdown**, allowing for bullet points,
links and other simple formatting to explain what the action does.

### Action Context

Few actions are relevant in all contexts. For this reason each action
specifies a `context` property. This property specifies when an action
is relevant. Actions *relevant* for a task should be displayed in a
context menu for the given task. Similarly actions *not relevant* for a
given task should not be displayed in the context menu for the given
task.

As a special case we say that actions for which *no relevant* contexts
can exist, are *relevant* for the task-group. This could for example be
an action to create tasks that was optimized away.

The `context` property is specified as a list of *tag-sets*. A *tag-set*
is a set of key-value pairs. A task is said to *match* a *tag-set* if
`task.tags` is a super-set of the *tag-set*. An action is said to be
*relevant* for a given task, if `task.tags` *match* one of the
*tag-sets* given in the `context` property for the action.

Naturally, it follows that an action with an empty list of *tag-sets* in
its `context` property cannot possibly be *relevant* for any task.
Hence, by previously declared special case such an action is *relevant*
for the task-group.

**Examples**:

```js
// Example task definitions (everything but tags eclipsed)
TaskA = {..., tags: {kind: 'test', platform: 'linux'}}
TaskB = {..., tags: {kind: 'test', platform: 'windows'}}
TaskC = {..., tags: {kind: 'build', platform: 'linux'}}

Action1 = {..., context: [{kind: 'test'}]}
// Action1 is relevant to: TaskA, TaskB

Action2 = {..., context: [{kind: 'test', platform: 'linux'}]}
// Action2 is relevant to: TaskA

Action3 = {..., context: [{platform: 'linux'}]}
// Action3 is relevant to: TaskA, TaskC

Action4 = {..., context: [{kind: 'test'}, {kind: 'build'}]}
// Action4 is relevant to: TaskA, TaskB, TaskC

Action5 = {..., context: [{}]}
// Action5 is relevant to: TaskA, TaskB, TaskC (all tasks in fact)

Action6 = {..., context: []}
// Action6 is relevant to the task-group
```

### Action Input

An action can take JSON input, the input format accepted by an action is
specified using a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). This schema is
specified with by the action's `schema` property. For example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "actions": [
    {
      "kind": "task",
      "name": "thing",
      "title": "Do A Thing",
      "description": "Do something",
      "schema": {
        "description": "The thing to do",
        "title": "Thing",
        "default": "something",
        "type": "string",
        "maxLength": 255
      },
      "task": {
        "payload": {
          "env": {
            "INPUT_JSON": {"$json": {"$eval": "input"}}
          },
          ...
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  ],
  "variables": {}
}
```

User interfaces for triggering actions, like Treeherder, are expected to
provide JSON input that satisfies this schema. These interfaces are also
expected to validate the input against the schema before attempting to
trigger the action.

It is perfectly legal to reference external schemas using constructs
like `{"$ref": "https://example.com/my-schema.json"}`, in this case it
however strongly recommended that the external resource is available
over HTTPS and allows CORS requests from any source.

When writing schemas it is strongly encouraged that the JSON schema
`description` properties are used to provide detailed descriptions. It
is assumed that consumers will render these `description` properties as
markdown.

In practice it's encouraged that consumers employ a facility that can generate
HTML forms from JSON schemas. However, if certain schemas are particularly
complicated or common, consumers may also hand-write a user-interface for
collecting the input. In this case the consumer **must** do a deep comparison
between the schema given in the action, and the schema for which a custom
user-interface have been written, and fall-back to an auto-generated form if
the schema doesn't match.

### Variables

The `public/actions.json` artifact has a `variables` property that is a
mapping from variable names to JSON values to be used as constants.
These variables can be referenced from task templates, but beware that
they may overshadow builtin variables. This is mainly useful to
deduplicate commonly used values, in order to reduce template size. This
feature does not introduce further expressiveness.

### JSON-e Context

Most kinds use [JSON-e](https://github.com/taskcluster/json-e) to render
templates.  The context for that rendering contains:

`taskGroupId`:   the `taskGroupId` of task-group this is triggered from

`taskId`:   the `taskId` of the selected task, `null` if no task is selected
    (this is the case if the action has `context: []`).

`task`:   (`kind == 'task'` only) the task definition of the selected task,
    or `null` if no task is selected (this is the case if the action has `context:
    []`). For `kind == 'hook'`, the temptation to rely on this unstrusted information
    would be too great -- fetch the `taskId` from the Queue instead.

`ownTaskId`:   (`kind == 'task'` only) the `taskId` of the action task itself.
    This is useful for indexing without collisions and other similar needs; for
    `kind == 'hook'`, use the `taskId` provided by [the hooks
    service](/docs/reference/core/taskcluster-hooks/docs/firing-hooks).

`input`:   the input matching the `schema` property, `null` if the action
    doesn't have a `schema` property. See "Action Input" below.

`<key>`:   Any `<key>` defined in the `variables` property may also be
    referenced. See "Variables" below.

Do not confuse the JSON-e context (used to render a template) with the action
context (used to control which actions apply to which tasks).

The following **example** demonstrates how a task template can specify
timestamps and dump input JSON into environment variables:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "actions": [
    {
      "kind": "task",
      "name": "thing",
      "title": "Do A Thing",
      "description": "Do something",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "thing": {
            "description": "The thing to do",
            "type": "string",
            "maxLength": 255,
            "default": "something"
          }
        }
      },
      "task": {
        "workerType": "my-worker",
        "payload": {
          "created": {"$fromNow": ""},
          "deadline": {"$fromNow": "1 hour 15 minutes"},
          "expiration": {"$fromNow": "14 days"},
          "image": "my-docker-image",
          "env": {
            "TASKID_TRIGGERED_FOR": "${taskId}",
            "REVISION": "${revision}",
            "THING_TO_DO": {"$eval": "input.thing"}
          },
          ...
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  ],
  "variables": {
    "revision": "123abc"
  }
}
```

## Kinds

### "task" kind

An action with `kind: 'task'` specifies a task that the user interface
should create. That is, when the action is triggered, the user interface
calls the Taskcluster API to create a new task, with the content of that
task determined from `actions.json`.

The task created by the action may be useful in its own right (for
example, running a test with additional debugging), or it may simplify
trigger in-tree scripts that create new tasks. The latter form is called
an *action task*, and is similar to a decision task. This allows in-tree
scripts to execute complicated actions such as backfilling.

Actions of the `'task'` *kind* **must** have a `task` property. This
property specifies the task template to be parameterized and created in
order to trigger the action.

### "hook" kind

An action with `kind: 'hook'` specifies a hook that should be triggered via the
[`hooks.triggerHook`](/docs/reference/core/taskcluster-hooks/references/api#triggerHook)
API method when the action is executed.  The hook is specified in the `hookId`
and `hookGroupId` properties.

An advantage of the hooks service is that it can create tasks that have scopes
which the user calling `triggerHook` does not have - a kind of privilege
escalation. In this case, it means that the user initiating an action need not
have the scopes required to actually execute the action task. The
`hooks:trigger-hook:<hookGroupId>/<hookId>` scope can limit which users can
initiate the action, and the hook's task template and `payloadSchema` together
limit what the resulting task does.

The payload of the `triggerHook` call is given by the `hookPayload` property,
which is rendered using JSON-e with the context described above.

Note that the result of rendering `hookPayload` becomes the *context* for
another JSON-e rendering performed by the hooks service.  Do not confuse the
two operations!

## Formal Specification

The JSON Schema for `actions.json` is available from the
`taskcluster-references` repository in [this
directory](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-references/tree/master/schemas).
