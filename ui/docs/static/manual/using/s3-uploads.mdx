title: Uploading to S3
order: 70
---

Many projects upload the result of their build or release process to Amazon S3
for hosting.  For example, a package might upload its generated documentation
to a bucket for hosting on a custom domain, or a blog site might upload the
rendered site to a bucket. For these cases, Taskcluster artifacts are not
suitable.

The recommended approach to this requirement is to store S3 credentials in the
[taskcluster-secrets service](/docs/reference/core/taskcluster-secrets), then
download those credentials within the task and use them to upload the
appropriate files.

## IAM Setup

To begin, create an AWS IAM user with limited permission to perform the actions
you expect your task to perform. The IAM policy language is arcane at best. Here
is a starter policy allowing upload access to the bucket `myblog.com`:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::myblog.com"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::myblog.com/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

A few tips:
 * Tools that "synchronize" rather than just upload will need to list the bucket
   contents. If this is not required, you can omit the first statement.
 * Many upload tools intended to upload to public buckets use
   `PutObjectAcl` (or pass an ACL to `PutObject`, which has the same effect), so
   it is helpful to include that action in the list.
 * If the bucket is shared with other uses, the `*` in the second statement can be
   extended to include only a specific prefix, e.g., `myblog.com/blog/*`.

Generate an AWS access key ID and secret access key for this new user .
*Warning* do not simply generate credentials for your own, administrative user!
While this solution is is secure, it is easy to accidentally disclose the
credentials while debugging.

## Secret Setup

Set up a new secret using the [secret
tool](https://tools.taskcluster.net/secrets), named after the repository from
which the task runs, e.g., `repo:github.com/myblog/myblog.com`. Add the
credentials:

```json
{
  "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "..",
  "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": ".."
}
```

Note that you may need some help from the Taskcluster team to get permission to
do this.

Then, add the scopes to read that secret to the appropriate repository role.
Keep in mind that, for Github repositories at least, it is possible to
distinguish PRs and specific branches.  If, for example, only the master branch
should be allowed to upload, then you would add add
`secrets:get:repo:github.com/myblog/myblog.com` to role
`repo:github.com/myblog/myblog.com:branch:master`.

## Task Setup

In the repository's `.taskcluster.yml`, set up a task with the necessary bits
to perform the upload:

```yaml
tasks:
  - ...
    # only run on pushes to master
    extra:
      github:
        branches: [master]
        events: [push]
    # task has access to the secret
    scopes: [secrets:get:repo:github.com/myblog/myblog.com]
    payload:
	  # the script will use taskclusterProxy to read the secret
      features:
        taskclusterProxy: true
      command:
        - '/bin/bash'
        - '--login'
        - '-c'
        - >-
          git clone {{event.head.repo.url}} repo && cd repo && git checkout {{event.head.sha}} && ./upload.sh
```

The `upload.sh` script looks like this:

```sh
#! /bin/sh
# stop on errors -- do NOT set -x here, or you will disclose your secret access key!
set -e
# the `secrets.get" endpoint, using the taskcluster proxy (http://taskcluster)
export secret_url="http://taskcluster/secrets/v1/secret/repo:github.com/myblog/myblog.com"
# fetch and decode the two secrets
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(curl ${secret_url} | python -c 'import json, sys; a = json.load(sys.stdin); print a["secret"]["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"]')
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(curl ${secret_url} | python -c 'import json, sys; a = json.load(sys.stdin); print a["secret"]["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]')

# use the AWS CLI to actually upload the data
aws s3 sync --exclude "assets/*" --exclude "data/*" --exclude "img/*" --delete ./site/ s3://myblog.com
```

You will, of course, need to adapt this to your needs, and ensure that the task
runs in a Docker image that contains Python and the AWS CLI.
