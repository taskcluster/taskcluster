If you are making API requests on behalf of a less-trusted entity that you only
know to possess a subset of your [scopes](scopes), you can specify the scopes a
given request is authorized to rely on. If the request cannot be authorized
with the restricted set of scopes you specified, it will fail, even though you
may in fact have the scopes required to conduct the request. In effect, you can
reduce the available scopes for each API request.

**Example**, imagine that CRAN service would like to create Taskcluster tasks
whenever an R project is updated in the archive. However, different R packages
have different levels of trust and require different scopes. The tc-cran
service runs with the superset of all scopes that might be required (perhaps
`assume:project:cran:pkg:*`), and calls `queue.createTask` with
`authorizedScopes` set to `['assume:project:cran:pkg:paleotree']` for paleotree
tasks. The scopes available for creating that task are then limited to those
assigned to the paleotree package via its role.

Authorized scopes are specified in the Hawk `ext` property with the
`authorizedScopes` property. The Taskcluster client packages all contain
support for this functionality.

```js
{
  authorizedScopes:  ['scopeA', 'scopeC']
}
```

**Remark**, it is possible to use authorized scopes in combination with the
certificate used temporary credentials. Just include both fields in the JSON
object before base64 encoding into the `ext` property.

**Note** the way Hawk works, the `ext` property is covered by the HMAC
signature. So it's not possible to modify this property on-the-fly.
