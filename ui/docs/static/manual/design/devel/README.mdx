This section of the manual contains information useful for people working on
the Taskcluster codebase.

contains the source code for all of the microservices, a collection of
supporting libraries, and more.

You can find a list of [open pull
requests](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Ataskcluster+is%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=searchresults),
or the aggregated [Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/taskcluster) to see
