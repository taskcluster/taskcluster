Taskcluster manages major changes to the platform through "requests for
comment", known as RFCs.  These provide an open, transparent decision-making
process and a way to track ideas from initial proposal through decision and
implementation.

Taskcluster's RFCs are in the [taskcluster-rfcs repository](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs).
