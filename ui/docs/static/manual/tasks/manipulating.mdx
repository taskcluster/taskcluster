For the most part, once a task is created it is left to run to its final
resolution. However, there are a few API methods available to modify its
behavior after creation.

Permission for these methods is based on the task's `schedulerId`.

## Force Scheduling

A task which has unfinished dependencies is considered "unscheduled", and not yet
"pending". A scheduled task that depends on itself will remain in that state
until its deadline, unless it is *force-scheduled* with the Queue service's
`scheduleTask` method.

## Cancelling

A task that is not yet complete can be cancelled. This is generally a
best-effort operation, useful for saving resources. Task execution may continue
for some time after an active task is cancelled, until the worker performing
the task attempts to reclaim it.
