title: Taskcluster Reference
---

This portion of the Taskcluster documentation contains reference material.
Consult the [manual](/docs/manual) for the background to this information.

For each service or library, the main page is based on the project's README,
with additional pages describing the project in more detail.

Most of this material here is automatically generated when services are
deployed in production or when new revisions are pushed to libraries, so it is
generally completely up to date.
