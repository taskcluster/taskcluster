title: Finding Tasks
---

The "table of contents" for Taskcluster tasks is the
[Index](https://tools.taskcluster.net/index/). When a task completes
successfully, it is added to the index at an "index route" given by any
`task.routes` entries that begin with `index.`. (Actually, the Queue just
[sends pulse messages to well-known exchanges](/docs/reference/platform/queue/exchanges).
The Index listens to `index.*` for task completion, and indexes the tasks appropriately).

What that means is, you can use the [Index Browser](https://tools.taskcluster.net/index/)
to find tasks.  The precise format of the index paths is partially defined in the
[namespaces](/docs/manual/devel/namespaces) document.
