# Taskcluster UI

This repository contains a collection of useful tools for use with Taskcluster.
Generally, we strive to not add UI to Taskcluster components, but instead offer
well documented APIs that can be easily consumed using a client library for
Taskcluster.

## Web Server

The taskcluster-ui application relies on a server application in order to
perform queries to the Taskcluster APIs. That package is
[web-server](../services/web-server).
**Follow the instructions** for starting it prior to launching
the web UI. You will need to launch web-server in a terminal
instance separate from the UI in order to run both simultaneously.

For development, the web-server process must be serving on
http://localhost:3050, but otherwise need not be publicly accessible. The
development server for this repo will proxy requests as necessary to
http://localhost:3050.

## Development

To get started local development, just:

* ensure web-server is running as suggested above
* change to the `ui/` directory
* install the dependencies with `yarn`
* start the UI server with `yarn start`

## Configuration

You can customize the settings if you'd like, but this is not required for most development.
To pass one of these values during development, specify it in the environment, e.g.,
```bash
export APPLICATION_NAME="My UI"
yarn start
```

_IMPORTANT_: All configuration for the UI is passed to the browser of every user.
Do not send secret data!

### Implementation

The frontend reads configuraiton variables from relative URL `./static/env.js` on page load.
This file is written during `yarn start`, based on environment variables.
In a real deployment, this file is written during the docker-container startup process, based on deployment configuration.

### Application Name

```bash
APPLICATION_NAME="Taskcluster"
```

_Note: The `APPLICATION_NAME` can be whatever you wish it to be._

### Port

You can optionally specify the port on which the development server serves with

```bash
PORT=9000
```

### GraphQL Endpoints

If you are not running the web service on your local machine, you will also need to set

```bash
GRAPHQL_SUBSCRIPTION_ENDPOINT=https://mydomain.com/subscription
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://mydomain.com/graphql
```

The Taskcluster team has a series of [best practices](../dev-docs/best-practices/ui.mdx) for the UI which may help
guide you in modifying the source code and making a pull request.

### Docs Only

If you are only looking to deploy the docs site, configure `DOCS_ONLY` to be `true`.

### Login Strategies

Login strategies are specifed in `UI_LOGIN_STRATEGY_NAMES`, split on space. They are used to identify which
login widget(s) to display to the end user.

Taskcluster supports the following strategies:
* `github` - GitHub
* `mozilla-auth0` - Mozilla Auth0

_Example: Enabling the `github` and `mozilla-auth0` strategies_

```bash
UI_LOGIN_STRATEGY_NAMES="github mozilla-auth0"
```

_Note: Each strategy requires its own set of config in `web-server`. Be sure to reference the
[web-server instructions](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/master/services/web-server#login-strategies)
for properly configuring the server._

### Tracking Events

Google Analytics can be leveraged to track page views and click events.
Set up Analytics by including a the tracking ID (a string like UA-XXXXXXXX) environment variable.

```bash
GA_TRACKING_ID=XXXXXXXX
```

Once the tracking code is identified, the client will send a page event on each page view.
Moreover, the `Button` component is able to send an event when clicked by setting
the Button's `track` property.

### Reporting Errors

The `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable can be used to set up Sentry to monitor and fix crashes.

### Configuration Implementation



## Icons

You can browse a list of available icons at:

https://materialdesignicons.com/

These can be imported into the app by using the Pascal-cased name of the icon from the
[`mdi-react`](https://github.com/levrik/mdi-react) package<sup>*</sup>.
For example, if you would like to use the `book-open-page-variant` icon, you can import it with:

```jsx
import BookOpenPageVariantIcon from 'mdi-react/BookOpenPageVariantIcon';

// ...

<BookOpenPageVariantIcon />
```

<sup>* We use this library because it provides substantially more icons with minimal file-system headaches.</sup>

## Necessary Practices

1. For views showing secret, user-linked data or are using `client.fetchMore` to load more data
on page load, graphql queries of that view must include the `fetchPolicy: 'network-only'` option to ensure
data reflects the user's permissions and is up-to-date when a user logs in/out.
