Worker Manager now takes optional configuration to change the timings on the lib-iterate loops
that control provisioning. The values are `worker_manager.provisioner_iterate_config` and
`worker_manager.worker_scanner_iterate_config`. Each is a JSON object where you can set the following:

* `maxFailures` - Which sets how many iterations in a row can fail before the task crashes
* `maxIterationTime` - How long (in ms) an iteration is allowed to take before it is ended
* `waitTime` - How long (in ms) to wait in between loops
