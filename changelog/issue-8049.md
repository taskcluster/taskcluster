#### API Documentation Now Includes Code Examples

The API reference documentation now includes code examples for every endpoint in multiple languages:
- **curl** - Raw HTTP requests
- **Go** - Go client library
- **Python** - Synchronous and asynchronous client libraries
- **Node.js** - Node.js client library
- **Web** - Browser/web client library
- **Rust** - Rust client library
- **Shell** - Taskcluster CLI (taskcluster-cli)

Each example demonstrates how to:
- Set up the client with authentication (both explicit credentials and environment variables)
- Call the API endpoint with proper parameters
- Handle errors appropriately
- Process the response

Examples are generated dynamically in the browser from API metadata, keeping the documentation lean while providing comprehensive, up-to-date code samples. Examples include syntax highlighting and can be copied to clipboard directly from the documentation.
