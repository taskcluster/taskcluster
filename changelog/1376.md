[PATCH] ([#1376](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/issues/1376)) Next and previous buttons did not display on docs pages where url ended in "/" such as Tasks, Task Execution, Access Control, System Design. Also did not display if "/" was manually added. Buttons will now display with or without "/".
