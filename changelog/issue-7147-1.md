Worker Manager: `shouldWorkerTerminate` API now takes the pool's running capacity and `minCapacity` config into account to properly adhere to the `minCapacity` setting.

Generic Worker: if Worker Manager determines the worker should stay alive when the worker's idle timeout hits, the timeout will reset and the worker will continue running to hold a true `minCapacity` in the worker pool.
