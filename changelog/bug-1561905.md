---

1. Static clients need to be updated in deployments.
2. The web-server service now requires azure credentials configured for login to work properly, namely
`AZURE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `AZURE_SIGNING_KEY`, and `AZURE_CRYPTO_KEY`.
3. For a third party to get TC credentials, it first needs to have a client registered in the deployment of the
web-server service. This is governed by the `REGISTERED_CLIENTS` configuration.
See https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/manual/deploying/third-party for the shape of a client.
