Generic Worker Chain Of Trust feature now allows tasks to inject additional data into public/chain-of-trust.json. Tasks wishing to add additional fields should write them as json to the file chain-of-trust-additional-data.json in the task directory. In this initial release, there are no provisions to customise the name of path of the file. The file contents will be merged with the default chain of trust certificate, with the default field values taking precedence over any provided in `chain-of-trust-additional-data.json`. If the file is not created by the task, no merging will take place, and the feature will operate as before.
