==================================================
Version     = '[48]'
Schema      = 'http://schemas.taskcluster.net/base/v1/api-reference.json#'
Title       = 'Authentication API'
Description = 'Authentication related API end-points for Taskcluster and related
services. These API end-points are of interest if you wish to:
  * Authorize a request signed with Taskcluster credentials,
  * Manage clients and roles,
  * Inspect or audit clients and roles,
  * Gain access to various services guarded by this API.

Note that in this service "authentication" refers to validating the
correctness of the supplied credentials (that the caller posesses the
appropriate access token). This service does not provide any kind of user
authentication (identifying a particular person).

### Clients
The authentication service manages _clients_, at a high-level each client
consists of a `clientId`, an `accessToken`, scopes, and some metadata.
The `clientId` and `accessToken` can be used for authentication when
calling Taskcluster APIs.

The client's scopes control the client's access to Taskcluster resources.
The scopes are *expanded* by substituting roles, as defined below.

### Roles
A _role_ consists of a `roleId`, a set of scopes and a description.
Each role constitutes a simple _expansion rule_ that says if you have
the scope: `assume:<roleId>` you get the set of scopes the role has.
Think of the `assume:<roleId>` as a scope that allows a client to assume
a role.

As in scopes the `*` kleene star also have special meaning if it is
located at the end of a `roleId`. If you have a role with the following
`roleId`: `my-prefix*`, then any client which has a scope staring with
`assume:my-prefix` will be allowed to assume the role.

### Guarded Services
The authentication service also has API end-points for delegating access
to some guarded service such as AWS S3, or Azure Table Storage.
Generally, we add API end-points to this server when we wish to use
Taskcluster credentials to grant access to a third-party service used
by many Taskcluster components.'

a given `bucket` and `prefix` within that bucket.
The `level` parameter can be `read-write` or `read-only` and determines
which type of credentials are returned. Please note that the `level`
parameter is required in the scope guarding access.  The bucket name must
not contain `.`, as recommended by Amazon.

This method can only allow access to a whitelisted set of buckets.  To add
a bucket to that whitelist, contact the Taskcluster team, who will add it to
the appropriate IAM policy.  If the bucket is in a different AWS account, you
will also need to add a bucket policy allowing access from the Taskcluster
account.  That policy should look like this:

```js
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "allow-taskcluster-auth-to-delegate-access",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::692406183521:root"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The credentials are set to expire after an hour, but this behavior is
subject to change. Hence, you should always read the `expires` property
from the response, if you intend to maintain active credentials in your
application.

Please note that your `prefix` may not start with slash `/`. Such a prefix
is allowed on S3, but we forbid it here to discourage bad behavior.

Also note that if your `prefix` doesn't end in a slash `/`, the STS
credentials may allow access to unexpected keys, as S3 does not treat
slashes specially.  For example, a prefix of `my-folder` will allow
access to `my-folder/file.txt` as expected, but also to `my-folder.txt`,
which may not be intended.

Finally, note that the `PutObjectAcl` call is not allowed.  Passing a canned
ACL other than `private` to `PutObject` is treated as a `PutObjectAcl` call, and
will result in an access-denied error from AWS.  This limitation is due to a
security flaw in Amazon S3 which might otherwise allow indefinite access to
uploaded objects.

**EC2 metadata compatibility**, if the querystring parameter
`?format=iam-role-compat` is given, the response will be compatible
with the JSON exposed by the EC2 metadata service. This aims to ease
compatibility for libraries and tools built to auto-refresh credentials.
For details on the format returned by EC2 metadata service see:
[EC2 User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#instance-metadata-security-credentials).'

Version     = '[48]'
Schema      = 'http://schemas.taskcluster.net/base/v1/api-reference.json#'
Title       = 'AWS Provisioner API Documentation'
Description = 'The AWS Provisioner is responsible for provisioning instances on EC2 for use in
Taskcluster.  The provisioner maintains a set of worker configurations which
can be managed with an API that is typically available at
aws-provisioner.taskcluster.net/v1.  This API can also perform basic instance
management tasks in addition to maintaining the internal state of worker type
configuration information.

The Provisioner runs at a configurable interval.  Each iteration of the
provisioner fetches a current copy the state that the AWS EC2 api reports.  In
each iteration, we ask the Queue how many tasks are pending for that worker
type.  Based on the number of tasks pending and the scaling ratio, we may
submit requests for new instances.  We use pricing information, capacity and
utility factor information to decide which instance type in which region would
be the optimal configuration.

Each EC2 instance type will declare a capacity and utility factor.  Capacity is
the number of tasks that a given machine is capable of running concurrently.
Utility factor is a relative measure of performance between two instance types.
We multiply the utility factor by the spot price to compare instance types and
regions when making the bidding choices.

When a new EC2 instance is instantiated, its user data contains a token in
`securityToken` that can be used with the `getSecret` method to retrieve
the worker's credentials and any needed passwords or other restricted
information.  The worker is responsible for deleting the secret after
retrieving it, to prevent dissemination of the secret to other proceses
which can read the instance user data.

needed for the provisioner to manage the instances.  Each worker type
knows which regions and which instance types are allowed for that
worker type.  Remember that Capacity is the number of concurrent tasks
that can be run on a given EC2 resource and that Utility is the relative
performance rate between different instance types.  There is no way to
configure different regions to have different sets of instance types
so ensure that all instance types are available in all regions.
This function is idempotent.

Once a worker type is in the provisioner, a back ground process will
begin creating instances for it based on its capacity bounds and its
pending task count from the Queue.  It is the worker's responsibility
to shut itself down.  The provisioner has a limit (currently 96hours)
for all instances to prevent zombie instances from running indefinitely.

The provisioner will ensure that all instances created are tagged with
aws resource tags containing the provisioner id and the worker type.

If provided, the secrets in the global, region and instance type sections
are available using the secrets api.  If specified, the scopes provided
will be used to generate a set of temporary credentials available with
the other secrets.'

      description: |
        A scaling ratio of `0.2` means that the provisioner will attempt to keep
        the number of pending tasks around 20% of the provisioned capacity.
        This results in pending tasks waiting 20% of the average task execution
        time before starting to run.
        A higher scaling ratio often results in better utilization and longer
        waiting times. For workerTypes running long tasks a short scaling ratio
        may be preferred, but for workerTypes running quick tasks a higher scaling
        ratio may increase utilization without major delays.
        If using a scaling ratio of 0, the provisioner will attempt to keep the
        capacity of pending spot requests equal to the number of pending tasks.

      description: |
        A scaling ratio of `0.2` means that the provisioner will attempt to keep
        the number of pending tasks around 20% of the provisioned capacity.
        This results in pending tasks waiting 20% of the average task execution
        time before starting to run.
        A higher scaling ratio often results in better utilization and longer
        waiting times. For workerTypes running long tasks a short scaling ratio
        may be preferred, but for workerTypes running quick tasks a higher scaling
        ratio may increase utilization without major delays.
        If using a scaling ratio of 0, the provisioner will attempt to keep the
        capacity of pending spot requests equal to the number of pending tasks.

Title       = 'Hooks API Documentation'
Description = 'Hooks are a mechanism for creating tasks in response to events.

Hooks are identified with a `hookGroupId` and a `hookId`.

When an event occurs, the resulting task is automatically created.  The
task is created using the scope `assume:hook-id:<hookGroupId>/<hookId>`,
which must have scopes to make the createTask call, including satisfying all
scopes in `task.scopes`.  The new task has a `taskGroupId` equal to its
`taskId`, as is the convention for decision tasks.

Hooks can have a "schedule" indicating specific times that new tasks should
be created.  Each schedule is in a simple cron format, per 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron-parser.  For example:
 * `['0 0 1 * * *']` -- daily at 1:00 UTC
 * `['0 0 9,21 * * 1-5', '0 0 12 * * 0,6']` -- weekdays at 9:00 and 21:00 UTC, weekends at noon

The task definition is used as a JSON-e template, with a context depending on how it is fired.  See
https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/core/taskcluster-hooks/docs/firing-hooks
for more information.'

===================================================
Version     = '[48]'
Schema      = 'http://schemas.taskcluster.net/base/v1/api-reference.json#'
Title       = 'Task Index API Documentation'
Description = 'The task index, typically available at `index.taskcluster.net`, is
responsible for indexing tasks. The service ensures that tasks can be
located by recency and/or arbitrary strings. Common use-cases include:

 * Locate tasks by git or mercurial `<revision>`, or
 * Locate latest task from given `<branch>`, such as a release.

**Index hierarchy**, tasks are indexed in a dot (`.`) separated hierarchy
called a namespace. For example a task could be indexed with the index path
`some-app.<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. In this case the following
namespaces is created.

 1. `some-app`,
 1. `some-app.<revision>`, and,
 2. `some-app.<revision>.linux-64`

Inside the namespace `some-app.<revision>` you can find the namespace
`some-app.<revision>.linux-64` inside which you can find the indexed task
`some-app.<revision>.linux-64.release-build`. This is an example of indexing
builds for a given platform and revision.

**Task Rank**, when a task is indexed, it is assigned a `rank` (defaults
to `0`). If another task is already indexed in the same namespace with
lower or equal `rank`, the index for that task will be overwritten. For example
consider index path `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`. In
this case one might choose to use a UNIX timestamp or mercurial revision
number as `rank`. This way the latest completed linux 64 bit release
build is always available at `mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build`.

Note that this does mean index paths are not immutable: the same path may
point to a different task now than it did a moment ago.

**Indexed Data**, when a task is retrieved from the index the result includes
a `taskId` and an additional user-defined JSON blob that was indexed with
the task.

**Entry Expiration**, all indexed entries must have an expiration date.
Typically this defaults to one year, if not specified. If you are
indexing tasks to make it easy to find artifacts, consider using the
artifact's expiration date.

**Valid Characters**, all keys in a namespace `<key1>.<key2>` must be
in the form `/[a-zA-Z0-9_!~*'()%-]+/`. Observe that this is URL-safe and
that if you strictly want to put another character you can URL encode it.

**Indexing Routes**, tasks can be indexed using the API below, but the
most common way to index tasks is adding a custom route to `task.routes` of the
form `index.<namespace>`. In order to add this route to a task you'll
need the scope `queue:route:index.<namespace>`. When a task has
this route, it will be indexed when the task is **completed successfully**.
The task will be indexed with `rank`, `data` and `expires` as specified
in `task.extra.index`. See the example below:

```js
{
  payload:  { /* ... */ },
  routes: [
    // index.<namespace> prefixed routes, tasks CC'ed such a route will
    // be indexed under the given <namespace>
    "index.mozilla-central.linux-64.release-build",
    "index.<revision>.linux-64.release-build"
  ],
  extra: {
    // Optional details for indexing service
    index: {
      // Ordering, this taskId will overwrite any thing that has
      // rank <= 4000 (defaults to zero)
      rank:       4000,

      // Specify when the entries expire (Defaults to 1 year)
      expires:          new Date().toJSON(),

      // A little informal data to store along with taskId
      // (less 16 kb when encoded as JSON)
      data: {
        hgRevision:   "...",
        commitMessae: "...",
        whatever...
      }
    },
    // Extra properties for other services...
  }
  // Other task properties...
}
```

**Remark**, when indexing tasks using custom routes, it's also possible
to listen for messages about these tasks. For
example one could bind to `route.index.some-app.*.release-build`,
and pick up all messages about release builds. Hence, it is a
good idea to document task index hierarchies, as these make up extension
points in their own.'

set of Taskcluster credentials for use on behalf of the identified
user.

This method is typically not called with a Taskcluster client library
and does not accept Hawk credentials. The `access_token` should be
given in an `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer abc.xyz
```

The `access_token` is first verified against the named
:provider, then passed to the provider's API to retrieve a user
profile. That profile is then used to generate Taskcluster credentials
appropriate to the user. Note that the resulting credentials may or may
not include a `certificate` property. Callers should be prepared for either
alternative.

The given credentials will expire in a relatively short time. Callers should
monitor this expiration and refresh the credentials if necessary, by calling

taken care of. Ideally, you should use a much shorter deadline.

**Task expiration**, the `expires` property must be greater than the
task `deadline`. If not provided it will default to `deadline` + one
year. Notice, that artifacts created by task must expire before the task.

**Task specific routing-keys**, using the `task.routes` property you may
define task specific routing-keys. If a task has a task specific 
routing-key: `<route>`, then when the AMQP message about the task is
published, the message will be CC'ed with the routing-key: 
`route.<route>`. This is useful if you want another component to listen
for completed tasks you have posted.  The caller must have scope
`queue:route:<route>` for each route.

**Dependencies**, any tasks referenced in `task.dependencies` must have
already been created at the time of this call.

**Important** Any scopes the task requires are also required for creating
the task. Please see the Request Payload (Task Definition) for details.'

it doesn't have any runs, an initial run will be added and resolved as
described above. Hence, after canceling a task, it cannot be scheduled
with `queue.scheduleTask`, but a new run can be created with
`queue.rerun`. These semantics is equivalent to calling
`queue.scheduleTask` immediately followed by `queue.cancelTask`.

    Entry Description = 'This API end-point creates an artifact for a specific run of a task. This
should **only** be used by a worker currently operating on this task, or
from a process running within the task (ie. on the worker).

All artifacts must specify when they `expires`, the queue will
automatically take care of deleting artifacts past their
expiration point. This features makes it feasible to upload large
intermediate artifacts from data processing applications, as the
artifacts can be set to expire a few days later.

We currently support 3 different `storageType`s, each storage type have
slightly different features and in some cases difference semantics.
We also have 2 deprecated `storageType`s which are only maintained for
backwards compatiability and should not be used in new implementations

**Blob artifacts**, are useful for storing large files.  Currently, these
are all stored in S3 but there are facilities for adding support for other
backends in futre.  A call for this type of artifact must provide information
about the file which will be uploaded.  This includes sha256 sums and sizes.
This method will return a list of general form HTTP requests which are signed
by AWS S3 credentials managed by the Queue.  Once these requests are completed
the list of `ETag` values returned by the requests must be passed to the
queue `completeArtifact` method

**S3 artifacts**, DEPRECATED is useful for static files which will be
stored on S3. When creating an S3 artifact the queue will return a
pre-signed URL to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your
artifact. Note that `PUT` request **must** specify the `content-length`
header and **must** give the `content-type` header the same value as in
the request to `createArtifact`.

**Azure artifacts**, DEPRECATED are stored in _Azure Blob Storage_ service
which given the consistency guarantees and API interface offered by Azure
is more suitable for artifacts that will be modified during the execution
of the task. For example docker-worker has a feature that persists the
task log to Azure Blob Storage every few seconds creating a somewhat
live log. A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL
featuring a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),
refer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.
**Warning: azure artifact is currently an experimental feature subject
to changes and data-drops.**

**Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
store for you. These artifacts really only have a `url` property and
when the artifact is requested the client will be redirect the URL
provided with a `303` (See Other) redirect. Please note that we cannot
delete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the
reference to the artifact, when it expires.

**Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will
store for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the
worker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you
would otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an
error artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or
turns out to be a directory. Clients requesting an error artifact will
get a `403` (Forbidden) response. This is mainly designed to ensure that
dependent tasks can distinguish between artifacts that were suppose to
be generated and artifacts for which the name is misspelled.

**Artifact immutability**, generally speaking you cannot overwrite an
artifact when created. But if you repeat the request with the same
properties the request will succeed as the operation is idempotent.
This is useful if you need to refresh a signed URL while uploading.
Do not abuse this to overwrite artifacts created by another entity!
Such as worker-host overwriting artifact created by worker-code.

As a special case the `url` property on _reference artifacts_ can be
updated. You should only use this to update the `url` property for
reference artifacts your process has created.'

workers in-order to reduce bandwidth costs. This can lead to longer
response times. Caching can be skipped by setting the header
`x-taskcluster-skip-cache: true`, this should only be used for resources
where request volume is known to be low, and caching not useful.

The response is paged. If this end-point returns a `continuationToken`, you
should call the end-point again with the `continuationToken` as a query-string
option. By default this end-point will list up to 1000 workers in a single

    Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
    provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

    An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
    together with a webhook for triggering it.

    The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
    provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
    type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
    the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
    URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
    user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

    The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
    called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
    are registered against the provisioner when calling
    `queue.declareProvisioner`.

    The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
    interface to present the action to the user as follows:

    | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
    |-------------|--------------------------------|
    | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |
    | worker-type | Workers Explorer               |
    | worker      | Worker Explorer                |

                  the task, upload artifacts and report task resolution.

                  The temporary credentials are set to expire after `takenUntil`. They
                  won't expire exactly at `takenUntil` but shortly after, hence, requests

                  clock drift.

                  Workers should use these credentials when making requests on behalf of
                  a task. This includes requests to create artifacts, reclaiming the task
                  reporting the task `completed`, `failed` or `exception`.

                  Note, a new set of temporary credentials is issued when the worker

                        to attach informal metadata to a task. Use this for informal tags that

          Temporary credentials granting `task.scopes` and the scope:
          `queue:claim-task:<taskId>/<runId>` which allows the worker to reclaim
          the task, upload artifacts and report task resolution.

          The temporary credentials are set to expire after `takenUntil`. They
          won't expire exactly at `takenUntil` but shortly after, hence, requests
          coming close `takenUntil` won't have problems even if there is a little
          clock drift.

          Workers should use these credentials when making requests on behalf of
          a task. This includes requests to create artifacts, reclaiming the task
          reporting the task `completed`, `failed` or `exception`.

          Note, a new set of temporary credentials is issued when the worker
          reclaims the task.

                    Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
                    provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

                    An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
                    together with a webhook for triggering it.

                    The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
                    provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
                    type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
                    the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
                    URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
                    user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

                    The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
                    called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
                    are registered against the provisioner when calling
                    `queue.declareProvisioner`.

                    The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
                    interface to present the action to the user as follows:

                    | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
                    |-------------|--------------------------------|
                    | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |

            Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
            provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

            An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
            together with a webhook for triggering it.

            The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
            provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
            type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
            the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
            URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
            user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

            The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
            called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
            are registered against the provisioner when calling
            `queue.declareProvisioner`.

            The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
            interface to present the action to the user as follows:

            Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
            provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

            An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
            together with a webhook for triggering it.

            The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
            provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
            type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
            the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
            URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
            user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

            The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
            called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
            are registered against the provisioner when calling
            `queue.declareProvisioner`.

            The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
            interface to present the action to the user as follows:

            | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
            |-------------|--------------------------------|
            | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |
            | worker-type | Workers Explorer               |
            | worker      | Worker Explorer                |

            See [actions docs](https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/actions)
            for more information.

          reporting the task `completed`, `failed` or `exception`.

  Temporary credentials granting `task.scopes` and the scope:
  `queue:claim-task:<taskId>/<runId>` which allows the worker to reclaim
  the task, upload artifacts and report task resolution.

  The temporary credentials are set to expire after `takenUntil`. They
  won't expire exactly at `takenUntil` but shortly after, hence, requests
  coming close `takenUntil` won't have problems even if there is a little
  clock drift.

  Workers should use these credentials when making requests on behalf of
  a task. This includes requests to create artifacts, reclaiming the task
  reporting the task `completed`, `failed` or `exception`.

  Note, a new set of temporary credentials is issued when the worker
  reclaims the task.

      description: |
        Reason that the task is resolved with an exception. This is a subset
        of the values for `resolvedReason` given in the task status structure.
        **Report `worker-shutdown`** if the run failed because the worker
        had to shutdown (spot node disappearing). In case of `worker-shutdown`
        the queue will immediately **retry** the task, by making a new run.
        This is much faster than ignoreing the issue and letting the task _retry_
        by claim expiration. For any other _reason_ reported the queue will not
        retry the task.
        **Report `malformed-payload`** if the `task.payload` doesn't match the
        schema for the worker payload, or referenced resource doesn't exists.
        In either case, you should still log the error to a log file for the
        specific run.
        **Report `resource-unavailable`** if a resource/service needed or
        referenced in `task.payload` is _temporarily_ unavailable. Do not use this
        unless you know the resource exists, if the resource doesn't exist you
        should report `malformed-payload`. Example use-case if you contact the
        index (a service) on behalf of the task, because of a declaration in
        `task.payload`, and the service (index) is temporarily down. Don't use
        this if a URL returns 404, but if it returns 503 or hits a timeout when
        you retry the request, then this _may_ be a valid exception. The queue
        assumes that workers have applied retries as needed, and will not retry
         the task.
        **Report `internal-error`** if the worker experienced an unhandled internal
        error from which it couldn't recover. The queue will not retry runs
        resolved with this reason, but you are clearly signaling that this is a
        bug in the worker code.
        **Report `superseded`** if the task was determined to have been
        superseded by another task, and its results are no longer needed.  It is
        convention in this case to create an artifact entitled
        `public/superseded-by` containing the taskId of the task that superseded
        this one.
        **Report `intermittent-task`** if the task explicitly requested a retry
        because task is intermittent. Workers can choose whether or not to
        support this, but workers shouldn't blindly report this for every task
        that fails.

          Temporary credentials granting `task.scopes` and the scope:
          `queue:claim-task:<taskId>/<runId>` which allows the worker to reclaim
          the task, upload artifacts and report task resolution.

          The temporary credentials are set to expire after `takenUntil`. They
          won't expire exactly at `takenUntil` but shortly after, hence, requests
          coming close `takenUntil` won't have problems even if there is a little
          clock drift.

          Workers should use these credentials when making requests on behalf of
          a task. This includes requests to create artifacts, reclaiming the task
          reporting the task `completed`, `failed` or `exception`.

          Note, a new set of temporary credentials is issued when the worker
          reclaims the task.

        associated with the task. This can be data for the task which doesn't
        fit into `payload`, or it can supplementary data for use in services
        listening for events from this task. For example this could be details to
        display on _treeherder_, or information for indexing the task. Please, try
        to put all related information under one property, so `extra` data keys
        for treeherder reporting and task indexing don't conflict, hence, we have
        reusable services. **Warning**, do not stuff large data-sets in here,
        task definitions should not take-up multiple MiBs.

            Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
            provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

            An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
            together with a webhook for triggering it.

            The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
            provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
            type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
            the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
            URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
            user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

            The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
            called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
            are registered against the provisioner when calling
            `queue.declareProvisioner`.

            The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
            interface to present the action to the user as follows:

            | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
            |-------------|--------------------------------|
            | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |
            | worker-type | Workers Explorer               |
            | worker      | Worker Explorer                |

            See [actions docs](https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/actions)
            for more information.

          Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
          provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

          An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
          together with a webhook for triggering it.

          The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
          provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
          type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
          the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
          URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
          user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

          The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
          called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
          are registered against the provisioner when calling
          `queue.declareProvisioner`.

          The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
          interface to present the action to the user as follows:

          | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
          |-------------|--------------------------------|
          | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |
          | worker-type | Workers Explorer               |
          | worker      | Worker Explorer                |

          See [actions docs](https://docs.taskcluster.net/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/actions)
          for more information.

  Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
  provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

  An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
  together with a webhook for triggering it.

  The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
  provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
  type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
  the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
  URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
  user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

  The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
  called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
  are registered against the provisioner when calling
  `queue.declareProvisioner`.

  The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
  interface to present the action to the user as follows:

  | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
  |-------------|--------------------------------|
  | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |
  | worker-type | Workers Explorer               |
  | worker      | Worker Explorer                |

Title           = 'Queue AMQP Exchanges'
Description     = 'The queue, typically available at `queue.taskcluster.net`, is responsible
for accepting tasks and track their state as they are executed by
workers. In order ensure they are eventually resolved.

This document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows
third-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.
These exchanges targets the following audience:
 * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,
 * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),
 * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.

You'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same
routing key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages
about a certain kind tasks.

**Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using
the `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details
on permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has
the entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in
`task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the
routing-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.

These routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere
with the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the
_primary_ routing key is always prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured
in the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.

Please, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive
in your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with
multiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing
routing keys.

**Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,
which means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests
will ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.
This is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but
when re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend
any related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.

This shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using
confirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,
this only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.

**Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the
server crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the
future. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us
if this corner case is of concern to you.'

This means that the actual artifact is rarely available when this message
is posted. But it is not unreasonable to assume that the artifact will
will become available at some point later. Most signatures will expire in
30 minutes or so, forcing the uploader to call `createArtifact` with
the same payload again in-order to continue uploading the artifact.

However, in most cases (especially for small artifacts) it's very
reasonable assume the artifact will be available within a few minutes.
This property means that this exchange is mostly useful for tools
monitoring task evaluation. One could also use it count number of
artifacts per task, or _index_ artifacts though in most cases it'll be
smarter to index artifacts after the task in question have completed
successfully.'

        Labels are a dimension of a platform.  The values here can vary wildly,

        is maleable going forward.

        These were formerly known as "Options" within "Option Collections" but
        calling labels now so they can be understood to be just strings that
        denotes a characteristic of the job.

        Some examples of labels that have been used:
          opt    Optimize Compiler GCC optimize flags
          debug  Debug flags passed in
          pgo    Profile Guided Optimization - Like opt, but runs with profiling, then builds again using that profiling
