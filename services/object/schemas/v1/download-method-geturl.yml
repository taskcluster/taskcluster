    title: 'getUrl Download Response'
    description: |-
      This download method returns a URL from which the data may be fetched with an HTTP GET request.

      The client should begin a GET request as soon as possible after receiving the reponse.
      The server will respond with a 200 OK containing the data, or with a 4xx or 5xx error response.
      It will _not_ redirect to another URL (3xx), and the client should not follow any such redirects.

      The client can use standard Range requests to download portions of the object or to resume an interrupted download.
      Per the HTTP standard, servers may return more data than requested by the Range header.

      If retrying a failed or interrupted download, and the `expires` field is in the past, the client should call `startDownload` again to get an updated `url`.
      The client can assume that the object data and `hashes` will be the same for all calls to `startDownload`.

      The client can use standard Accept-Encoding headers to indicate the encodings it can accept.
      However, in a deviation from standard HTTP, the client _must_ accept at least `identity` and `gzip` encodings.
      If the HTTP response has a `Content-Encoding` header, the client should decode the body before verifying its hashes and returning it to the application.

      The client _must_ verify that the resulting data matches the supplied hashes.
      The object service does not, itself, validate object data and relies on clients to do so.
