    pattern:        {$const: projectId-pattern}
  uploadId:
    title: "Upload ID"
    description: |-
      Unique identifier for this upload.   Once an object is created with an uploadId,
      uploads of the same object with different uploadIds will be rejected.  Callers
      should pass a randomly-generated slugid here.
    type:             string

  expires:
    title:          "Expiration"

  proposedUploadMethods:
    type: object
    title: "Proposed Upload Methods"
    description: |
      Upload methods, with details, that the caller is prepared to execute.  If
      this object is empty, then the server will reject the request but still
      create the upload with the given `uploadId`, `projectId`, and `expires`,
      so any subsequent calls must share those values.  The server may choose
      any of the proposed methods at its discretion.
