/**
 * BaseNode is the base-class for all node in an object-structure that holds a
 * tree of sorted scope sets as they are being merged.
 *
 * Merging a large set of normalized scope-sets using mergeScopeSets(A, B) is
 * expensive as it can only merge two scope-sets at a time, and allocates a new
 * array for all intermediate results. The complexity of merging N scopes split
 * between M scope-sets approaches something like O(N * M).
 *
 * Instead we shall create a binary tree of nodes where each leaf holds a
 * scope-set, then we compute the next value for internal node by taking the
 * value from a child. This leaves us with an average complexity closer to
 * something like O(N * log(M)), notes this just not proven math, merely a
 * casual guess backed by benchmarks.
 *
 * To make it even faster we allow nodes to return a different node (or this)
 * from the node.next() function, such that the return value is the tree after
 * consumption of the current value. As a final technicality we leave node.value
 * undefined until the first call of node.next(), such that we can support empty
 * nodes by returning null from node.next().
