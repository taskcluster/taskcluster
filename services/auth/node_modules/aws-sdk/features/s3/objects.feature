Feature: Working with Objects in S3

  As a user of S3
  I need to be able to work with objects in a bucket.

  Scenario: CRUD objects
    When I write "world" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain "world"
    When I write "new world" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    Then the object with the key "hello" should contain "new world"

    # Empty files
    When I write "" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain ""

    # ContentLength
    When I write "foobar" to the key "hello" with ContentLength 3
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain "foo"

    # UTF-8
    When I write "åß∂ƒ©" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain "åß∂ƒ©"

    When I copy an object with the key "hello" to "byebye"
    Then the object with the key "byebye" should exist
    And the object with the key "byebye" should contain "åß∂ƒ©"
    And I delete the object with the key "byebye"

    When I delete the object with the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should not exist

  @presigned
  Scenario: Pre-signed URLs
    Given I get a pre-signed URL to PUT the key "hello"
    And I access the URL via HTTP PUT with data "PRESIGNED BODY CONTENTS"
    When I get a pre-signed URL to GET the key "hello"
    And I access the URL via HTTP GET
    Then the HTTP response should equal "PRESIGNED BODY CONTENTS"

  @presigned @checksum
  Scenario: Pre-signed URLs with checksum
    Given I get a pre-signed URL to PUT the key "hello" with data "CHECKSUMMED"
    And I access the URL via HTTP PUT with data "NOT CHECKSUMMED"
    Then the HTTP response should contain "SignatureDoesNotMatch"

  @buffer
  Scenario: Buffers and streams
    When I write buffer "world" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain "world"

    When I write file "testfile.txt" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain "CONTENTS OF FILE"

    When I stream key "hello"
    Then the streamed data should contain "CONTENTS OF FILE"

    When I stream2 key "hello"
    Then the streamed data should contain "CONTENTS OF FILE"

  @progress
  Scenario: Progress events
    When I write a 512KB buffer to the key "hello" with progress events
    Then more than 1 "httpUploadProgress" event should fire
    And the "total" value of the progress event should equal 512KB
    And the "loaded" value of the first progress event should be greater than 10 bytes

    When I read the key "hello" with progress events
    Then more than 1 "httpDownloadProgress" event should fire
    And the "total" value of the progress event should equal 512KB
    And the "loaded" value of the first progress event should be greater than 10 bytes

  @proxy
  Scenario: Proxy support
    When I write "world" to the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should exist
    And the object with the key "hello" should contain "world"

    When I delete the object with the key "hello"
    Then the object with the key "hello" should not exist

    And I teardown the local proxy server

  @pagination
  Scenario: Paginating responses
    Given I delete the object with the key "hello"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj0"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj1"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj2"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj3"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj4"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj5"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj6"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj7"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj8"
    And I write "data" to the key "obj9"
    And the object with the key "obj9" should exist
    And I setup the listObjects request for the bucket
    When I paginate the "listObjects" operation with limit 3
    Then I should get 4 pages
