discussion](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues/384)\n\nBugfixes\n\n### 1.7.0 [See discussion](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues/288)\n\nAdded `moment.fn.endOf()` and `moment.fn.startOf()`.\n\nAdded validation via `moment.fn.isValid()`.\n\nMade formatting method 3x faster. http://jsperf.com/momentjs-cached-format-functions\n\nAdd support for month/weekday callbacks

[See discussion](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/pull/268)\n\nAdded Durations.\n\nRevamped parser to support parsing non-separated strings (YYYYMMDD vs YYYY-MM-DD).\n\nAdded support for millisecond parsing and formatting tokens (S SS SSS)\n\nAdded a getter for `moment.lang()`\n\nVarious bugfixes.\n\nThere are a few things deprecated in the 1.6.0 release.\n\n1. The format tokens `z` and `zz` (timezone abbreviations like EST CST MST etc) will no longer be supported. Due to inconsistent browser support, we are unable to consistently produce this value. See [this issue](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues/162) for more background.\n\n2. The method `moment.fn.native` is deprecated in favor of `moment.fn.toDate`. There continue to be issues with Google Closure Compiler throwing errors when using `native`, even in valid instances.\n\n3. The way to customize am/pm strings is being changed. This would only affect you if you created a custom language file. For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/pull/222).\n\n### 1.5.0 [See milestone](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues?milestone=10&page=1&state=closed)\n\nAdded UTC mode.\n\nAdded automatic ISO8601 parsing.\n\nVarious bugfixes.\n\n### 1.4.0 [See milestone](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues?milestone=8&state=closed)\n\nAdded `moment.fn.toDate` as a replacement for `moment.fn.native`.\n\nAdded `moment.fn.sod` and `moment.fn.eod` to get the start and end of day.\n\nVarious bugfixes.\n\n### 1.3.0 [See milestone](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues?milestone=7&state=closed)\n\nAdded support for parsing month names in the current language.\n\nAdded escape blocks for parsing tokens.\n\nAdded `moment.fn.calendar` to format strings like 'Today 2:30 PM', 'Tomorrow 1:25 AM', and 'Last Sunday 4:30 AM'.\n\nAdded `moment.fn.day` as a setter.\n\nVarious bugfixes\n\n### 1.2.0 [See milestone](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues?milestone=4&state=closed)\n\nAdded timezones to parser and formatter.\n\nAdded `moment.fn.isDST`.\n\nAdded `moment.fn.zone` to get the timezone offset in minutes.\n\n### 1.1.2 [See milestone](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues?milestone=6&state=closed)\n\nVarious bugfixes\n\n### 1.1.1 [See milestone](https://github.com/timrwood/moment/issues?milestone=5&state=closed)\n\nAdded time specific diffs (months, days, hours, etc)\n\n### 1.1.0\n\nAdded `moment.fn.format` localized masks.
