  "readme": "express-sslify\n==============\n\nThis simple module enforces HTTPS connections on any incoming requests. In case of a non-encrypted HTTP request, express-sslify automatically redirects to an HTTPS address using a 301 permanent redirect.\n\nexpress-sslify also works behind reverse proxies (load balancers) as they are for example used by Heroku and nodejitsu. In such cases, however, the `trustProxy` parameter has to be set (see below)\n\n### Usage\n\nFirst, install the module:\n\n`$ npm install express-sslify --save`\n\nAfterwards, require the module and *use* the `HTTPS()` method:\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar enforce = require('express-sslify');\n\nvar app = express();\n\n// use HTTPS(true) in case you are behind a load balancer (e.g. Heroku)\napp.use(enforce.HTTPS());\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function() {\n\tconsole.log('Express server listening on port ' + app.get('port'));\n});\n```\n\n### Reverse Proxies (Heroku, nodejitsu and others)\n\nHeroku, nodejitsu and other hosters often use reverse proxies which offer SSL endpoints but then forward unencrypted HTTP traffic to the website. This makes it difficult to detect if the original request was indeed via HTTPS. Luckily, most reverse proxies set the `x-forwarded-proto` header flag with the original request scheme. express-sslify is ready for such scenarios, but you have to specifically request the evaluation of this flag:\n\n`app.use(enforce.HTTPS(true))`\n\nPlease do *not* set this flag if you are not behind a proxy that is setting this flag as such flags can be easily spoofed in a direct client/server connection.\n",
