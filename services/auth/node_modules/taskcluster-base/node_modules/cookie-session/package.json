  "readme": "# cookie-session [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/cookie-session.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/cookie-session) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cookie-session.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/cookie-session)\n\n  Simple cookie-based session middleware.\n\n## Semantics\n\n  This module provides \"guest\" sessions, meaning any visitor will have a session,\n  authenticated or not. If a session is _new_ a `Set-Cookie` will be produced regardless\n  of populating the session.\n\n## API\n\n  View counter example:\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express')\nvar session = require('cookie-session')\n\nvar app = express()\n\napp.use(session({\n  keys: ['key1', 'key2'],\n  secureProxy: true // if you do SSL outside of node\n}))\n\napp.use(function (req, res, next) {\n  var n = req.session.views || 0\n  req.session.views = ++n\n  res.end(n + ' views')\n})\n\napp.listen(3000)\n```\n\n### Options\n\n  - `name` - The cookie name. Defaults to `express:sess`.\n  - `keys` - Keys with which to sign the cookie. See `signed` in cookie options. Multiple keys allows for using rotating credentials.\n  - `secret` - A string which will be used as single key if `keys` is not found.\n\n  Other options are passed to `cookies.get()` and\n  `cookies.set()` allowing you to control security, domain, path,\n  and signing among other settings.\n\n#### Cookie Options\n\n  - `maxage` - a number representing the milliseconds from `Date.now()` for expiry.\n  - `expires` - a `Date` object indicating the cookie's expiration date (expires at the end of session by default).\n  - `path` - a string indicating the path of the cookie (`/` by default).\n  - `domain` - a string indicating the domain of the cookie (no default).\n  - `secure` - a boolean indicating whether the cookie is only to be sent over HTTPS (`false` by default for HTTP, `true` by default for HTTPS).\n  - `secureProxy` - a boolean indicating whether the cookie is only to be sent over HTTPS (use this if you handle SSL outside your node process).\n  - `httpOnly` - a boolean indicating whether the cookie is only to be sent over HTTP(S), and not made available to client JavaScript (`true` by default).\n  - `signed` - a boolean indicating whether the cookie is to be signed (`true` by default). If this is true, another cookie of the same name with the `.sig` suffix appended will also be sent, with a 27-byte url-safe base64 SHA1 value representing the hash of _cookie-name_=_cookie-value_ against the first [Keygrip](https://github.com/jed/keygrip) key. This signature key is used to detect tampering the next time a cookie is received.\n  - `overwrite` - a boolean indicating whether to overwrite previously set cookies of the same name (`true` by default). If this is true, all cookies set during the same request with the same name (regardless of path or domain) are filtered out of the Set-Cookie header when setting this cookie.\n\n  Read more here: https://github.com/jed/cookies\n\n### Session.isNew\n\n  Is `true` if the session is new.\n\n### Destroying a session\n\n  To destroy a session simply set it to `null`:\n\n```js\nreq.session = null\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
