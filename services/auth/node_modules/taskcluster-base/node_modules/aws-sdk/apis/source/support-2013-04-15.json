This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.</p>\n    \n    <p>The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/support/trustedadvisor\">Trusted Advisor</a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. </p> \n    \n    <p>The following list describes the AWS Support case management actions: </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n<b>Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. </b>The actions <a>DescribeServices</a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels</a> enable you to obtain AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase</a> action. </li>\n      <li>\n<b>Case creation, case details, and case resolution.</b> The actions <a>CreateCase</a>, <a>DescribeCases</a>, and <a>ResolveCase</a> enable you to create AWS Support cases, retrieve them, and resolve them.</li>\n      <li>\n<b>Case communication.</b> The actions <a>DescribeCommunications</a> and <a>AddCommunicationToCase</a> enable you to retrieve and add communication to AWS Support cases. </li>\n    </ul>\n    \n    <p>The following list describes the actions available from the AWS Support service for  Trusted Advisor:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n<a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks</a> returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.</li> \n      <li>Using the CheckId for a specific check returned by DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult</a> to obtain the results for the check you specified.</li> \n      <li>\n<a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries</a> returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.</li>\n      <li>\n<a>RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck</a> requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check. </li>\n      <li>\n<a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses</a> reports the refresh status of one or more checks.  </li>\n    </ul>\n        \n    <p>For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p>\n    \n    <p>See the AWS Support <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html\">User Guide</a> for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources. </p>\n \n   \n  ",
