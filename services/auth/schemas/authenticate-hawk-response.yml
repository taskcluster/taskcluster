          Authentication scheme the client used. Generally, you don't need to
          read this property unless `hash` is provided and you want to validate
          the payload hash. Additional values may be added in the future.

        description: |
          Payload as extracted from `Authentication` header. This property is
          only present if a hash is available. You are not required to validate
          this hash, but if you do, please check `scheme` to ensure that it's
          on a scheme you support.
      clientId:
        description: |
          The `clientId` that made this request.  This may be the `id` supplied in
          the Authorization header, or in the case of a named temporary credential
          may be embedded in the payload.  In any case, this clientId can be used
          for logging, auditing, and identifying the credential but **must** not be
          used for access control.  That's what scopes are for.

      expires:
        description: |
          The expiration time for the credentials used to make this request.
          This should be treated as the latest time at which the authorization
          is valid.  For most cases, where the access being authorized occurs
          immediately, this field can be ignored, as the value will always be
          in the future if the status is `auth-success`.
