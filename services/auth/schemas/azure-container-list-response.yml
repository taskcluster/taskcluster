      A list of containers that are in an account.  Credentials are available for
      these containers from the `azureBlobSAS` method.

    type:             string
    title:            Continuation Token
    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of containers.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called this method with `continuationToken`
      until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
