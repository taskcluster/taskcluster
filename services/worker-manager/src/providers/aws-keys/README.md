## General Information on Endpoints

There are several endpoints on an instance related to the instance identity:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
```
(1) Produces the actual document, which is nothing special — just a JSON object with information about instance (region, id, AMI id etc.)

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature
```
(2) Produces a RSA-signed SHA256 digest (in a form of a base64-encoded string).

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/pkcs7
```
(3) Produces a PKCS7 document containing the DSA-signed SHA1 digest. Well documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html)

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/rsa2048
```
(4) Produces a PKCS7 document containing the RSA-signed SHA256 digest.

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/dsa2048
```
(5) At the time of writing, doesn't work 😛

## `RSA-key-forSignature` file

The public key for (2). Was obtained from AWS support.
