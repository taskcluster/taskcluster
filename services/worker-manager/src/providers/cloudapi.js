/**
 * All cloud providers we interface with have things like api request rate
 * limiting. This class provides an abstracted way to talk to them but pause
 * with backoffs when we're told to slow down.
 *
 * The constructor takes an array of `types`, each of which will be an individual
 * queue. This is useful because clouds often have different categories of request
 * tracked differently or count limits separately across regions.
 *
 * It also takes `apiRateLimits` which should have a key for each `type` and values
 * of `{interval, intervalCap}`. The meanings of these values can be found in
 * p-queue documentation. For each of these you can also specify a default for if you
 * have not set a value for a type.
 *
 * You must provide a taskcluster-lib-monitor logger to this class.
 *
 * Finally, it takes an `errorHandler` which is a function that takes an error and `tries` counter
 * as the arguments and must throw an error or return an object containing three values:
 *   backoff: which is a time in ms for how long requests should be paused
 *   level: a taskcluster-lib-monitor logging level for the message about this
 *   reason: a human-readable reason for the backoff
 * If you throw an error, this class will pass the error right back along to where
 * you called enqueue in the first place. This should be used for errors that are
 * expected or should not pause the entire provider.
