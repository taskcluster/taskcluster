 * A Worker represents a view of a managed instance at a specific time.  In

 * resources which are uniquely identifiable in a cloud provider or hosting
 * environment.  In EC2-Spot this is an EC2 instance.  In a data center, this
 * would be a VM or Physical machine.  This distinction is made so that the
 * worker manager can present APIs which do automated management of the
 * underlying resources.
