/**
 * A WorkerConfiguration in the simplest terms maps an identifier
 * to a list of worker type names and rules which can be used to generate
 * data for providers, bidding strategies and metadata services.
 *
 * The term "worker type" is an unfortunate name which represents various
 * things to various people.  In this service, it refers to a logical pool
 * of machines which can each execute a task with equivalent results.
 *
 * The arguments passed into the constructor are:
 *
 *   - id: string identifier for a worker configuration
 *   - workerTypeConfigurations: a configuration for each worker type
 *   - rules: a Ruleset
 *
 * Worker Type Configurations:
 *
 * This is a list of objects in the shape of {workerType} or {workerType,
 * biddingStrategyId, providerIds}.  The difference between these two shapes
 * reflects whether or not this worker configuration is provisioned or not.
 * There is no special handling for this case, rather that when either a bidding
 * strategy or provider asks for worker types relevant to it, it would not be included.
 *
 * This means that workers which are provisioned or not can exist within the same
 * "worker type" pool.
 *
 * In order to ensure that the difference between these two is clear, any
 * worker type which has either a provisonerIds list or biddingStrategyId must
 * have both.  The bidding strategy id is a string and provider ids is a list of
 * strings.  Each of these ids refers to the id of the respective type of object.
 *
 * Rules:
 *
 * The rules provided will be evaluated by bidding strategies, providers and
 * metadata endpoints.  Each evaluator of these rules will pass in the relevant
 * satisfiers for itself.  All of the rules must evaluate to an object in the
 * shape {workerType: String, provider: {}, biddingStrategy: {},
 * documentation: {}, schemas: {}}.  Each of these sections is relevant to an
 * area of the worker manager.  The bidding strategy data must be valid to the
 * bidding strategy selected for that worker type, likewise for the provider
 * data.  The API for documentation and schema will define what is required
 * there.  All validation of these values must be handled by the consuming
 * system.
 *
 * By having a single set of rules, we allow worker configuration maintainers
 * the ability to be very expressive.  A bidding strategy can evaluate the rules
 * without a providerId to get the global worker type maximum capacity, then
 * again for each provider to get the maximum for the specific capacity.
