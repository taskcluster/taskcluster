/**
 * A Provider implementation is a class which understands the details of a
 * specific resource pool.  For explaining the terms of the Provider model, an
 * example of an EC2 region is used.  This is not to suggest it being
 * impossible for other systems.
 *
 * Each provider needs to be able to list the instances which are managed by
 * it.  Each instance must be uniquely identifiable. This is because we need to
 * have tools to terminate specific instances which are problematic as well as
 * attribute specific task runs to workers.  The provider must also be able to
 * suggest bids for new capacity.  This will be based on the outcome of a call
 * to determine the demand of a specific bidding strategy.
 *
 * The Bid class will be used to represent the various bids being passed
 * between providers and bidding strategies.
 *
 * The provider must understand that workerTypes which no longer have an
 * associated worker configuration might still exist, so it must internally map
 * between instance and worker type.  In the EC2 case, this is acheived by tagging
 * each instance with the providerId and workerType fields.
 *
 * It is important to note that a Provider implementation should only concern
 * itself with providing and managing capacity.  It should never independently
 * decide to create capacity.  Another way to think of it is that a provider is
 * an adapter between the interface that Worker Manager expects and that
 * provided by the backing service.
