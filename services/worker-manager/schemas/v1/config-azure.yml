      An array of possible variations of workers for this pool.
      Each choice must include at least the required properties but can also include anything in
      the request body of [the virtual machine creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/createorupdate)
      api method. worker-manager sets the values of the `osProfile.adminPassword`, `osProfile.computerName`, `osProfile.customData`, `networkProfile.networkInterfaces`
      properties directly, and they cannot be overriden. It also fills in some basic labels, will generate a default description, and sets the `taskcluster`
      metadata key directly. You are free to set other metadata items though. A subset of these fields we require you to set such as `machineType`.

            This value is supplied unchanged as the `workerConfig` property of the `taskcluster` instance metadata attribute.
            The expectation is that the worker will merge this information with configuration from other sources,
            and this is precisely what [worker-runner](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/master/tools/worker-runner) does.
            This property must not be used for secret configuration, as it is visible both in the worker pool configuration and in the worker instance's metadata.
            Instead, put secret configuration in the [secrets service](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster/tree/master/tools/worker-runner#secrets).
