      An array of possible variations of workers for this pool. Each launch configuration must use one of two deployment modes:

      **Traditional Resource Deployment (azure-deployment-resources.json#):**
      Properties are passed to the [virtual machine creation API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/virtualmachines/createorupdate).
      worker-manager automatically overrides: `osProfile.adminPassword`, `osProfile.computerName`, `osProfile.customData`, `networkProfile.networkInterfaces`.
      You must provide required fields like `location`, `subnetId`, `hardwareProfile`, and `storageProfile`.

      **ARM Template Deployment (azure-arm-templates.json#):**
      Properties are passed to the [Azure Deployments API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/deployments/createorupdate).
      worker-manager automatically generates and passes these parameters:
        `location`, `adminUsername`, `adminPassword`, `computerName`, `customData`, `vmName`, `tags`.
      Your ARM template must accept and use these parameters. You must specify `location` parameter to determine the worker group.
      Deployments are created in the default resource group from providerConfig, unless overridden with `armDeploymentResourceGroup`.
      If a custom resource group is specified and doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

                    If `true`, Worker Manager will request a public IPv4 address for the worker.
                    This is set to `false` by default. It is typically only needed for Windows
                    workers that should allow incoming RDP connections from the public internet.

                    Note: this is only useful for the single resources deployment. For ARM template
                    deployments you can use template parameters to achieve same results.

                    should be ignored and treated as success if the VM is running.  The most common choice is `["OSProvisioningTimedOut"]`, which ignores failure
                    to start the Azure VM Agent.  This is appropriate on systems that do not or cannot run the agent.

                    Useful only for debugging template issues. Azure keeps a limited deployment history per resource group,
                    so enabling this may eventually block new deployments once the limit is reached.

                This value is supplied unchanged as the `workerConfig` property of the `taskcluster` instance metadata attribute.
                The expectation is that the worker will merge this information with configuration from other sources,
                and this is precisely what [worker-runner](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner) does.
                This property must not be used for secret configuration, as it is visible both in the worker pool configuration and in the worker instance's metadata.
                Instead, put secret configuration in the [secrets service](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner).
