      This value is supplied unchanged to the worker from the provider configuration.
      The expectation is that the worker will merge this information with configuration from other sources.
      This property must not be used for secret configuration, as it is visible both in the worker pool configuration and in the worker instance's metadata.
      Instead, put secret configuration in the secrets service.
