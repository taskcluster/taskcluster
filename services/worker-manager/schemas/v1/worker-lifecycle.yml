  Conditions a worker can reach and actions to take in the case that they do.
  Not all providers necessarily implement all features of this in the same way.
  Read the providers docs to understand exactly what it will do.

  registrationTimeout:
    title: Registration Timeout
    type: integer
    description: |
      Each worker in this pool has `registrationTimeout` seconds to
      register itself with worker-manager after it has
      been requsted from the cloud provider. After this
      timeout, worker-manager will terminate the instance,
      assuming it is broken.
  reregisterTimeout:
    title: Checkin Timeout
    type: integer
    default: 345600
    description: |
      If specified, workers in this pool must re-register via `reregister()`
      within `reregisterTimeout` seconds from the initial call to `register()`
      to get new credentials. If the worker has not done so, it will be
      terminated. This defaults to 96 hours.
