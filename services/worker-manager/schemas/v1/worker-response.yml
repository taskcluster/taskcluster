  quarantineUntil:
    title:        "Worker Quarantine"
    description: |
      Quarantining a worker allows the machine to remain alive but not accept jobs.
      Once the quarantineUntil time has elapsed, the worker resumes accepting jobs.
      Note that a quarantine can be lifted by setting `quarantineUntil` to the present time (or
      somewhere in the past).

  firstClaim:

    description: |
      Date of the first time this worker claimed a task.
    type:         string
    format:       date-time
  lastDateActive:
    title:        "Worker Last Date Active"
    description: |
      Date of the last time this worker was seen active. Updated each time a worker calls
      `queue.claimWork`, `queue.reclaimTask`, and `queue.declareWorker` for this task queue.
      `lastDateActive` is updated every half hour but may be off by up-to half an hour.
      Nonetheless, `lastDateActive` is a good indicator of when the worker was last seen active.
      This defaults to null in the database, and is set to the current time when the worker
      is first seen.

  state:
    title: State
    description: |
      A string specifying the state this worker is in so far as worker-manager knows.
      A "requested" worker is in the process of starting up, and if successful will enter
      the "running" state once it has registered with the `registerWorker` API method.  A
      "stopping" worker is in the process of shutting down and deleting resources, while
      a "stopped" worker is completely stopped.  Stopped workers are kept for historical
      purposes and are purged when they expire.  Note that some providers transition workers
      directly from "running" to "stopped".
      An "standalone" worker is a worker that is not managed by worker-manager, these workers
      are only known by the queue.
    type: string
    enum: ["requested", "running", "stopping", "stopped", "standalone"]
  capacity:
    title: Worker Capacity
    description: |
      Number of tasks this worker can handle at once. A worker capacity of 0 means
      the worker is not managed by worker manager and is only known to the queue, the
      true capacity is not known.
    type: integer

    description: |
      The provider that had started the worker and responsible for managing it.
      Can be different from the provider that's currently in the worker pool config.
      A providerId of "none" is used when the worker is not managed by worker manager.
