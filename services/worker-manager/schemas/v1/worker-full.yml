  state:
    title: State
    description: |
      A string specifying the state this worker is in so far as worker-manager knows.
      A "requested" worker is in the process of starting up, and if successful will enter
      the "running" state once it has registered with the `registerWorker` API method.  A
      "stopping" worker is in the process of shutting down and deleting resources, while
      a "stopped" worker is completely stopped.  Stopped workers are kept for historical
      purposes and are purged when they expire.  Note that some providers transition workers
      directly from "running" to "stopped".
    type: string
    enum: ["requested", "running", "stopping", "stopped"]
