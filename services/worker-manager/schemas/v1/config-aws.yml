            This value is supplied unchanged as the `workerConfig` property of the `taskcluster` instance metadata attribute.
            The expectation is that the worker will merge this information with configuration from other sources,
            and this is precisely what [taskcluster-worker-runner](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-worker-runner) does.
            This property must not be used for secret configuration, as it is visible both in the worker pool configuration and in the worker instance's metadata.
            Instead, put secret configuration in the [secrets service](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-worker-runner#secrets).
