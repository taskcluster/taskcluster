      the request body of [the instance creation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/instances/insert)
      api method from gcloud. That said, worker-manager sets `instanceName` and `serviceAccounts` directly and you
      cannot override these. It also fills in some basic labels, will generate a default description, and sets the `taskcluster`
      metadata key directly. You are free to set other metadata items though. A subset of these fields we require you to set such as `machineType`.

            Worker Manager's own configuration settings per launch configuration.
            The other properties of the launch configuration section are passed directly through to
            GCP APIs, whereas this section is interpreted directly by Worker Manager.

            This value is supplied unchanged as the `workerConfig` property of the `taskcluster` instance metadata attribute.
            The expectation is that the worker will merge this information with configuration from other sources,
            and this is precisely what [worker-runner](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner) does.
            This property must not be used for secret configuration, as it is visible both in the worker pool configuration and in the worker instance's metadata.
            Instead, put secret configuration in the [secrets service](https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs/reference/workers/worker-runner).
