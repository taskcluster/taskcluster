This features makes it feasible to upload large\nintermediate artifacts from data processing applications, as the\nartifacts can be set to expire a few days later.\n\nWe currently support 4 different `storageType`s, each storage type have\nslightly different features and in some cases difference semantics.\n\n**S3 artifacts**, is useful for static files which will be stored on S3.\nWhen creating an S3 artifact is create the queue will return a pre-signed\nURL to which you can do a `PUT` request to upload your artifact.

For example docker-worker has a feature that persists the\ntask log to Azure Blob Storage every few seconds creating a somewhat\nlive log. A request to create an Azure artifact will return a URL\nfeaturing a [Shared-Access-Signature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn140256.aspx),\nrefer to MSDN for further information on how to use these.\n\n**Reference artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you.

Please note that we cannot\ndelete artifacts you upload to other service, we can only delete the\nreference to the artifact, when it expires.\n\n**Error artifacts**, only consists of meta-data which the queue will\nstore for you. These artifacts are only meant to indicate that you the\nworker or the task failed to generate a specific artifact, that you\nwould otherwise have uploaded. For example docker-worker will upload an\nerror artifact, if the file it was supposed to upload doesn't exists or\nturns out to be a directory.

      "title": "Queue AMQP Exchanges",
      "description": "The queue, typically available at `queue.taskcluster.net`, is responsible\nfor accepting tasks and track their state as they are executed by\nworkers. In order ensure they are eventually resolved.\n\nThis document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows\nthird-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.\nThese exchanges targets the following audience:\n * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,\n * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),\n * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.\n\nYou'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same\nrouting key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages\nabout a certain kind tasks.\n\n**Task-graphs**, if the task-graph scheduler, documented elsewhere, is\nused to schedule a task-graph, the task submitted will have their\n`schedulerId` set to `'task-graph-scheduler'`, and their `taskGroupId` to\nthe `taskGraphId` as given to the task-graph scheduler. This is useful if\nyou wish to listen for all messages in a specific task-graph.\n\n**Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using\nthe `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details\non permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has\nthe entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in\n`task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the\nrouting-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.\n\nThese routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere\nwith the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the\n_primary_ routing key is alwasys prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured\nin the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.\n\nPlease, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive\nin your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with\nmultiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing\nrouting keys.\n\n**Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,\nwhich means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests\nwill ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.\nThis is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but\nwhen re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend\nany related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.\n\nThis shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using\nconfirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,\nthis only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.\n\n**Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the\nserver crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the\nfuture. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us\nif this corner case is of concern to you.",

You just specify the `taskId` in the list of `required` tasks.\nSee the example below, where the second task requires the first task.\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  tasks: [\n    {\n      taskId:     \"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\",\n      requires:   [],\n      ...\n    },\n    {\n      taskId:     \"73GsfK62QNKAk2Hg1EEZTQ\",\n      requires:   [\"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\"],\n      task: {\n        payload: {\n          env: {\n            DEPENDS_ON:  \"XgvL0qtSR92cIWpcwdGKCA\"\n          }\n          ...\n        }\n        ...\n      },\n      ...\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**The `schedulerId` property**, defaults to the `schedulerId` of this\nscheduler in production that is `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`. This\nproperty must be either undefined or set to `\"task-graph-scheduler\"`,\notherwise the task-graph will be rejected.\n\n**The `taskGroupId` property**, defaults to the `taskGraphId` of the\ntask-graph submitted, and if provided much be the `taskGraphId` of\nthe task-graph. Otherwise the task-graph will be rejected.\n\n**Task-graph scopes**, a task-graph is assigned a set of scopes, just\nlike tasks. Tasks within a task-graph cannot have scopes beyond those\nthe task-graph has. The task-graph scheduler will execute all requests\non behalf of a task-graph using the set of scopes assigned to the\ntask-graph. Thus, if you are submitting tasks to `my-worker-type` under\n`my-provisioner` it's important that your task-graph has the scope\nrequired to define tasks for this `provisionerId` and `workerType`.\nSee the queue for details on permissions required. Note, the task-graph\ndoes not require permissions to schedule the tasks. This is done with\nscopes provided by the task-graph scheduler.\n\n**Task-graph specific routing-keys**, using the `taskGraph.routes`\nproperty you may define task-graph specific routing-keys. If a task-graph\nhas a task-graph specific routing-key: `<route>`, then the poster will\nbe required to posses the scope `scheduler:route:<route>`. And when the\nan AMQP message about the task-graph is published the message will be\nCC'ed with the routing-key: `route.<route>`.
