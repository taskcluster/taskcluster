    description: |
      Additional data to be mixed to the mocked event object.
      This can be used to set some specific properties of the event or override the existing ones.
      For example:
        "ref": "refs/heads/main"
        "before": "000"
        "after": "111"
      To make sure which properties are available for each event type,
      please refer to the github [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)

      - title: Push events
        description: |
          Github sends `push` event for commits and for tags.
          To distinguish between those two, the `ref` property is used.
          If you want to mock a tag push, please specify `ref` property in the overrides:
          "ref": "refs/tags/v1.0.0"

      - title: Pull Request events
        description: |
          .taskcluster.yml supports `github-pull-request` and `github-pull-request-untrusted` events.
          The difference is that `github-pull-request-untrusted` will use different set of scopes.
          See [RFC 175](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0175-restricted-pull-requests.md)
