              candidates for formal meta-data. Something like
              `purpose: 'build' || 'test'` is a good example.

              associated with the task. This can be data for the task which doesn't
              fit into `payload`, or it can supplementary data for use in services
              listening for events from this task. For example this could be details to
              display on _treeherder_, or information for indexing the task. Please, try
              to put all related information under one property, so `extra` data keys
              for treeherder reporting and task indexing don't conflict, hence, we have
              reusable services. **Warning**, do not stuff large data-sets in here,
              task definitions should not take-up multiple MiBs.
