TaskCluster GitHub Service
==========================

This service monitors all of the repositories associated with an organization for changes and schedules TaskCluster tasks for any repository which contains a `.taskclusterrc` configuration file. The goal of this project is to provide project owners a method for scheduling jobs in TaskCluster which is quick and straight forward.

##Components

### API Server
Listens for WebHooks and, if they are valid, forwards them to a pulse exchange.

### Worker
Listens for WebHook triggered pulse messages and attempts to schedule TaskCluster tasks for any events related to a repository which contains a `.taskclusterrc` file.

##Contributing

###Run Tests
From the project's base run ``npm test``
*note:* Initially, this will only run unit tests. To run integration tests add pulse credentals to ``config/test.js``
