order: 20
---

Your main interface to Taskcluster-Github is via `.taskcluster.yml` in the root
of your project. This is a YAML file that specifies the tasks to run on
pushes, pull requests, or releases.

The format of the file is:

```yaml
version: 0
tasks:
  - (task definition)
  - ...
```

For a practical example, see the `.taskcluster.yml` [for Taskcluster-Github itself](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-github/blob/master/.taskcluster.yml).

The file has a simple templating pass applied.  Each task's `extra.github` property also defines some github-specific behaviors.

# Configuration in `extra.github`

## Environment Variables

If you wish to include the environment variables detailed below, set `task.extra.github.env`:

```yaml
version: 0
tasks:
 - ...
   extra:
     github:
       env: true
```

## Github Events

You can modify a task definition so that it will only run for specific Github
events, by setting `task.extra.github.events` to a list of event names:

```yaml
version: 0
tasks:
 - ...
   extra:
     github:
       events: [push, pull_request.opened, pull_request.synchronize]
```


The available events are:

  * `pull_request.assigned`
  * `pull_request.unassigned`
  * `pull_request.labeled`
  * `pull_request.unlabeled`
  * `pull_request.opened`
  * `pull_request.edited`
  * `pull_request.closed`
  * `pull_request.reopened`
  * `pull_request.synchronize` (a new commit is pushed to the branch in the PR. NOTE: There is no 'd' at the end of 'synchronize')
  * `push`                     (a push is made directly to the repo)
  * `release`                  (a new release published in any branch of the repo. NOTE: New tags are actually push events in github)
  * `tag`                      (a tag is pushed to the repo)

In almost all cases, you'll only want `[push, pull_request.opened, pull_request.synchronize]`.

### Branch Filtering

You can also modify a task definition so that it will only run for events on certain branches. For example, the task defined below will only run for pushes to the master branch:

```yaml
version: 0
tasks:
  - ...
    extra:
      github:
        events:
          - push
        branches:
          - master
```

You can even choose to exclude certain branches from your task run. The task will run only if it is not on one of the excluded branches. For example, the task defined below will only run for pushes **not** to the master branch:

```yaml
version: 0
tasks:
  - ...
    extra:
      github:
        events:
          - push
        excludeBranches:
          - master
```

If a branch is present in both, `task.extra.github.branches` is given preference over `task.extra.github.excludeBranches`.
Branch filtering doesn't work for releases.

### Roles

Pushes, pull requests, and releases all are given access to [scopes](/manual/design/apis/hawk/scopes) via [roles](/manual/design/apis/hawk/roles) in Taskcluster. Following are the roles assigned to each type of event:

* `Push` -- `assume:repo:github.com/<organization>/<repository>:branch:<branch>`
* `Pull Request` -- `assume:repo:github.com/<organization>/<repository>:pull-request`
* `Release` -- `assume:repo:github.com/<organization>/<repository>:release`

In the [role manager](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/roles/), you can set up roles however you like. To give permissions to every event in your repository, you can make a role `repo:github.com/<organization>/<repository>:*` or you can give fine-grained permissions to only releases or specific branches, etc. [Read more](/manual/design/apis/hawk/scopes) about how scopes and roles work to see what you can do. There are lots of examples in the roles inspector for other repositories that have been set up. Look for roles that begin with `repo:github.com/` to see how they work.

## Who Can Trigger Jobs?

Taskcluster-Github will always build pushes and releases.  For pull requests, two policies are available:

* `public` -- tasks are created for all pull requests.
* `collaborators` (the default) -- tasks are created if the user who made the pull request is a collaborator on the repository.
  Github [defines collaborators](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#list-collaborators) as "outside collaborators, organization members with access through team memberships, organization members with access through default organization permissions, and organization owners."

This policy is determined by consulting the top-level `allowPullRequests` property in `.taskcluster.yml` in the latest commit to the repository's *default branch* (not on the pull request head!).

For example:
```
version: 0
allowPullRequests: public
...
```

# Token Substitution and Environment Variables

The following tables list curly brace tokens (`{{ tokenName }}`) that can be
included in your `.taskcluster.yml` file which will be substituted at task
generation time.

In addition to these token substitutions, by setting `extra.github.env` to
`true` in `.taskcluster.yml`, your generated tasks will also include additional
environment variables with `GITHUB_` prefix. If these environment variables are
not required (i.e. you only require token substitutions) then you do not need
to set `extra.github.env`. These environment variables are also listed in the
tables below, where they occur. Currently not all token substitutions are
available as environment variables (notably, the release metadata).

## Deadlines and the fromNow function

A function `{{ $fromNow }}` is included in the syntax so that users may specify
consistent timeouts and deadlines. The function will accept parameters like:
`'1 day'`, `'3 hours'`, `'1 hour'`, etc.

```
---
version: 0
tasks:
  - payload:
      maxRunTime: 3600
      image: "node:<version>"
      command:
        - "test"
    deadline: "{{ '2 hours' | $fromNow }}" # the task will timeout if it doesn't complete within 2 hours
```

There is also a ``{{ timestamp }}`` token which corresponds to UNIX epoch in
milliseconds.
