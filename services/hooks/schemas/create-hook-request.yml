    # It would be prettier with:
    # {$ref: "http://schemas.taskcluster.net/hooks/v1/schedule.json"}

    # come to the "default" keyword.. I'm looking at an alernative that is
    # both faster and implements "default" correctly.
    # (there corner cases with anyof, and $ref that isn't handled well.)
