    A hook was fired, meaning that a task was created for it.  This is also
    logged when the attempt to fire the hook failed, in which case the 'result'
    field is "failed".  Since this is often the result of user error, the error
    message itself is not included; consult the last-fires for the indicated
    hook to see them.
