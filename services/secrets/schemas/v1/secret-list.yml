      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of provisioners.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called with `continuationToken` until you get a
      result without a `continuationToken`.
