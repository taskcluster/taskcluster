title: Worker Hierarchy
order: 30
---

The queue defines a hierarchy of resources that consume tasks from queues:

## Provisioners

[Provisioners](/docs/manual/task-execution/provisioning), identified with a
`provisionerId`, are responsible for groups of worker types. While some
provisioners, such as the AWS provisioner, are active software components,
others are simply identifiers within the Queue service's data structures.  For
example, there is no active management of the
[`releng-hardware`](https://tools.taskcluster.net/provisioners/releng-hardware)
`provisionerId`.

Provisioners can be declared, and metadata associated with them, via the
[declareProvisioner](/docs/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/references/api#declareProvisioner)
API method.

## Worker Types

[Worker Types](/docs/manual/tasks/workertypes), identified by
`provisionerId/workerType`, are nested under a single provisioner and gather
interchangeable workers that can all perform the same work. Tasks are queued
for a specific worker type, and workers claim work for a single worker type.

Worker types can be declared, and metadata associated with them, via the
[declareWorkerType](/docs/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/references/api#declareWorkerType)
API method.

## Workers

[Workers](/docs/manual/task-execution/workers) are the entities that actually
perform work, and are identified by `workerGroup/workerId`. A worker claims and
performs work from a single worker type.

Workers can be declared, and metadata associated with them, via the
[declareWorker](/docs/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/references/api#declareWorker)
API method.
