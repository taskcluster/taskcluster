      Signed URL to get message from the Azure Queue Storage queue, that holds
      messages for the given `provisionerId` and `workerType`. Note that this
      URL returns XML, see documentation for the Azure Queue Storage
      [REST API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179474.aspx)

      the task, just attach the entire XML response in the `xmlMessageÂ´
      property, then the queue will take care of the message.
      **Note**, in the future the `xmlMessage` will be required!
