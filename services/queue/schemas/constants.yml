# Description of actions. They are defined on the provisioner
action-description: |
  Actions provide a generic mechanism to expose additional features of a
  provisioner, worker type, or worker to Taskcluster clients.

  An action is comprised of metadata describing the feature it exposes,
  together with a webhook for triggering it.

  The Taskcluster tools site, for example, retrieves actions when displaying
  provisioners, worker types and workers. It presents the provisioner/worker
  type/worker specific actions to the user. When the user triggers an action,
  the web client takes the registered webhook, substitutes parameters into the
  URL (see `url`), signs the requests with the Taskcluster credentials of the
  user operating the web interface, and issues the HTTP request.

  The level to which the action relates (provisioner, worker type, worker) is
  called the action context. All actions, regardless of the action contexts,
  are registered against the provisioner when calling
  `queue.declareProvisioner`.

  The action context is used by the web client to determine where in the web
  interface to present the action to the user as follows:

  | `context`   | Tool where action is displayed |
  |-------------|--------------------------------|
  | provisioner | Provisioner Explorer           |
  | worker-type | Workers Explorer               |
  | worker      | Worker Explorer                |

  See [actions docs](/docs/reference/platform/taskcluster-queue/docs/actions)
  for more information.

# Description of the url property in an action.
action-url-description: |
  When an action is triggered, a request is made using the `url` and `method`.
  Depending on the `context`, the following parameters will be substituted in the url:

  | `context`   | Path parameters                                          |
  |-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
  | provisioner | <provisionerId>                                          |
  | worker-type | <provisionerId>, <workerType>                            |
  | worker      | <provisionerId>, <workerType>, <workerGroup>, <workerId> |

  _Note: The request needs to be signed with the user's Taskcluster credentials._
