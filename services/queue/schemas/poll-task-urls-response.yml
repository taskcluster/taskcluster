      description: |
        Object holding two signed URLs for an azure queue, one for fetching
        messages, and another for deleting messages. Remember to `claimTask`
        before deleting the message, and delete message even if the `claimTask`
        operation fails with a 400 status code. Don't delete it on other status
        codes!

          title:    "Signed Get Message URL"
          description: |
            Signed URL to get message from the Azure Queue Storage queue,
            that holds messages for the given `provisionerId` and `workerType`.
            Note that this URL returns XML, see documentation for the Azure
            Queue Storage
            [REST API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179474.aspx)
            for details.
            When you have a message you can use `claimTask` to claim the task.
            You will need to parse the XML reponse and base64 decode and
            JSON parse the `MessageText`.
            After you have called `claimTask` you **must** us the
            `signedDeleteUrl` to delete the message.
            **Remark**, you are allowed to append `&numofmessages=N`,
            where N < 32, to the URLs if you wish to obtain more than one
            message at the time.

          type:     string
          pattern:  ^https://
          title:    "Signed Delete Message URL"
          description: |
            Signed URL to delete messages that have been received using the
            `signedPollUrl`. You **must** do this to avoid receiving the same
            message again.
            To use this URL you must substitute `{{messageId}}` and
            `{{popReceipt}}` with `MessageId` and `PopReceipt` from the XML
            response the `signedPollUrl` gave you. It is important that you
            `encodeURIComponent` both `MessageId` and `PopReceipt` prior to
            substitution, otherwise you will experience intermittent failures!
            Note this URL only works with `DELETE` request.
