    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of tasks in the task-group.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listTaskGroup` with `continuationToken`
      until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
