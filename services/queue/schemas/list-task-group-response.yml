description: |
  Response from a `listTaskGroup` request.
type:               object
properties:
  taskGroupId:
    title:          "Task-Group Identifier"
    description: |
      Identifier for the task-group being listed.
    type:           string
    pattern:        {$const: slugid-pattern}
  members:
    type:           array
    title:          "Members of the Task-Group"
    description: |
      List of `taskId` for tasks in this task-group.
    items:
      title:          "Task Identifier"
      description: |
        `TaskId` for a task in the task-group being listed.
      type:           string
      pattern:        {$const: slugid-pattern}
  continuationToken:
    type:             string
    title:            "Continuation Token"
    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option if all the
      tasks in the task-group wasn't included in this result.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listTaskGroup` with `continuationToken`
      until you got a result without a `continuationToken`.
