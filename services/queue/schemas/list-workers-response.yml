          description: |
            Quarantining a worker allows the machine to remain alive but not accept jobs.
            Once the quarantineUntil time has elapsed, the worker resumes accepting jobs.
            Note that a quarantine can be lifted by setting `quarantineUntil` to the present time (or
            somewhere in the past).

  continuationToken:

    title:          "Continuation Token"
    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of workers in the worker-type.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listWorkerTypes` with `continuationToken`
      until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
