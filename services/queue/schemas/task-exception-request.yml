title:    Task Exception Request
description: |
  Request for a run of a task to be resolved with an exception
type:     object
properties:
  reason:
    enum:
      - worker-shutdown
      - malformed-payload
    description: |
      Reason that the task is resolved with an exception. This is a subset
      of the values for `resolvedReason` given in the task status structure.
      Please, report `worker-shutdown` if the run failed because the worker
      had to shutdown (spot node disappearing).
      And report `malformed-payload` if the `task.payload` doesn't match the
      schema for the worker payload, or referenced dependencies doesn't exists.
      In either case, you should still log the error to a log file under the
      specific run.
      In case if `worker-shutdown` the queue will immediately **retry** the
      task, by making a new run. This is much faster than ignoreing the issue
      and letting the task _retry_ by claim expiration. For any other _reason_
      reported the queue will not retry the task.
