  Temporary credentials granting `task.scopes` and the scope:
  `queue:claim-task:<taskId>/<runId>` which allows the worker to reclaim
  the task, upload artifacts and report task resolution.

  The temporary credentials are set to expire after `takenUntil`. They
  won't expire exactly at `takenUntil` but shortly after, hence, requests
  coming close `takenUntil` won't have problems even if there is a little
  clock drift.

  Workers should use these credentials when making requests on behalf of
  a task. This includes requests to create artifacts, reclaiming the task
  reporting the task `completed`, `failed` or `exception`.

  Note, a new set of temporary credentials is issued when the worker
  reclaims the task.
