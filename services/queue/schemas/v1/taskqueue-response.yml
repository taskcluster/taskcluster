  lastDateActive:
    title:        "Task queue Last Date Active"
    description: |
      Date of the last time this task queue was seen active. Updated each time a worker calls
      `queue.claimWork`, `queue.reclaimTask`, and `queue.declareWorker` for this task queue.
      `lastDateActive` is updated every half hour but may be off by up-to half an hour.
      Nonetheless, `lastDateActive` is a good indicator of when the task queue was last seen active.
