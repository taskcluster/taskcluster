  Definition of a task that can be scheduled
type:               object
properties:
  provisionerId:
    title:          "Provisioner Id"
    description: |
      Unique identifier for a provisioner, that can supply specified
      `workerType`. Deprecation is planned for this property as it
      will be replaced, together with `workerType`, by the new
      identifier `taskQueueId`.
    type:           string
    pattern:        {$const: provisionerid-pattern}
  workerType:
    title:          "Worker Type"
    description: |
      Unique identifier for a worker-type within a specific
      provisioner. Deprecation is planned for this property as it will
      be replaced, together with `provisionerId`, by the new
      identifier `taskQueueId`.
    type:           string
    pattern:        {$const: workertype-pattern}
  taskQueueId:
    title:          "Task Queue Id"
    description: |
      Unique identifier for a task queue
    type:           string
    pattern:        {$const: taskqueueid-pattern}
  schedulerId:
    title:          "Scheduler Identifier"
    description: |
        All tasks in a task group must have the same `schedulerId`. This is used for several purposes:

        * it can represent the entity that created the task;
        * it can limit addition of new tasks to a task group: the caller of
            `createTask` must have a scope related to the `schedulerId` of the task
            group;
        * it controls who can manipulate tasks, again by requiring
            `schedulerId`-related scopes; and
        * it appears in the routing key for Pulse messages about the task.
    type:           string
    default:        '-'
    minLength:      {$const: identifier-min-length}
    maxLength:      {$const: identifier-max-length}
    pattern:        {$const: identifier-pattern}
  projectId:
    title:          "Project Identifier"
    description: |
      The name for the "project" with which this task is associated.  This
      value can be used to control permission to manipulate tasks as well as
      for usage reporting.  Project ids are typically simple identifiers,
      optionally in a hierarchical namespace separated by `/` characters.
      This value defaults to `none`.
    type:           string
    default:        'none'
    minLength:      {$const: projectId-min-length}
    maxLength:      {$const: projectId-max-length}
    pattern:        {$const: projectId-pattern}
  taskGroupId:
    title:          "Task-Group Identifier"
    description: |
      Identifier for a group of tasks scheduled together with this task.
      Generally, all tasks related to a single event such as a version-control
      push or a nightly build have the same `taskGroupId`.  This property
      defaults to `taskId` if it isn't specified.  Tasks with `taskId` equal to
      the `taskGroupId` are, [by convention](/docs/manual/using/task-graph),
      decision tasks.
    type:           string
    pattern:        {$const: slugid-pattern}
  dependencies:
    title:          "Task Dependencies"
    description: |
      List of dependent tasks. These must either be _completed_ or _resolved_
      before this task is scheduled. See `requires` for semantics.
      There can be up to `max-task-dependencies` dependencies, but this value can be
      overridden per-deployment to allow lower values.
    type:           array
    default:        []
    items:
      title:        "Task Dependency"
      description: |
        The `taskId` of a task that must be resolved before this task is
        scheduled.
      type:         string
      pattern:      {$const: slugid-pattern}
    maxItems:       {$const: max-task-dependencies}
    uniqueItems:    true
  requires:
    title:          "Dependency Requirement Semantics"
    description: |
      The tasks relation to its dependencies. This property specifies the
      semantics of the `task.dependencies` property.
      If `all-completed` is given the task will be scheduled when all
      dependencies are resolved _completed_ (successful resolution).
      If `all-resolved` is given the task will be scheduled when all dependencies
      have been resolved, regardless of what their resolution is.
    type:           string
    enum:           {$const: dependency-relation}
    default:        'all-completed'
  routes:
    title:          "Task Specific Routes"
    description: |
      List of task-specific routes. Pulse messages about the task will be CC'ed to
      `route.<value>` for each `<value>` in this array.

      This array has a maximum size due to a limitation of the AMQP protocol,
      over which Pulse runs.  All routes must fit in the same "frame" of this
      protocol, and the frames have a fixed maximum size (typically 128k).
    type:           array
    default:        []
    items:
      title:        "Task Specific Route"
      description: |
        A task specific route.
      type:         string
      maxLength:    249
      minLength:    1
    maxItems:       64
    uniqueItems:    true
  priority:
    title:          "Task Priority"
    description: |
      Priority of task. This defaults to `lowest` and the scope
      `queue:create-task:<priority>/<provisionerId>/<workerType>` is required
      to define a task with `<priority>`. The `normal` priority is treated as
      `lowest`.
    type:           string
    default: 'lowest'
    enum:    {$const: task-priorities}

  retries:
    title:          "Retries"
    description: |
      Number of times to retry the task in case of infrastructure issues.
      An _infrastructure issue_ is a worker node that crashes or is shutdown,
      these events are to be expected.
    type:           integer
    minimum:        0
    maximum:        49
    default:        5
  created:          {$const: created}
  deadline:         {$const: deadline}
  expires:
    title:          "Expiration"
    description: |
      Task expiration, time at which task definition and status is deleted.
      Notice that all artifacts for the task must have an expiration that is no
      later than this. If this property isn't it will be set to `deadline`
      plus one year (this default may change).
    type:           string
    format:         date-time
  scopes:
    title:          "Scopes"
    description: |
      List of scopes that the task is authorized to use during its execution.
    type:           array
    uniqueItems: false
    items: {$const: scope}
  payload:
    title:          "Task Payload"
    description: |
      Task-specific payload following worker-specific format.
      Refer to the documentation for the worker implementing
      `<provisionerId>/<workerType>` for details.
    type:           object
  metadata:         {$ref: "task-metadata.json#"}
  tags:
    title:            "Tags"
    description: |
      Arbitrary key-value tags (only strings limited to 4k). These can be used
      to attach informal metadata to a task. Use this for informal tags that
      tasks can be classified by. You can also think of strings here as
      candidates for formal metadata. Something like
      `purpose: 'build' || 'test'` is a good example.
    type:             object
    default:          {}
    additionalProperties:
      type:           string
      maxLength:      4096
  extra:
    title:            "Extra Data"
    description: |
      Object with properties that can hold any kind of extra data that should be
      associated with the task. This can be data for the task which doesn't
      fit into `payload`, or it can supplementary data for use in services
      listening for events from this task. For example this could be details to
      display on dashboard, or information for indexing the task. Please, try
      to put all related information under one property, so `extra` data keys
      don't conflict.  **Warning**, do not stuff large data-sets in here --
      task definitions should not take-up multiple MiBs.
