  quarantineUntil:
    title:        "Worker Quarantine"
    description: |
      Quarantining a worker allows the machine to remain alive but not accept jobs.
      Once the quarantineUntil time has elapsed, the worker resumes accepting jobs.
      Note that a quarantine can be lifted by setting `quarantineUntil` to the present time (or
      somewhere in the past).

  firstClaim:
    title:        "First task claimed"
    description: |
      Date of the first time this worker claimed a task.
    type:         string
    format:       date-time
  lastDateActive:
    title:        "Worker Last Date Active"
    description: |
      Date of the last time this worker was seen active. Updated each time a worker calls
      `queue.claimWork`, `queue.reclaimTask`, and `queue.declareWorker` for this task queue.
      `lastDateActive` is updated every half hour but may be off by up-to half an hour.
      Nonetheless, `lastDateActive` is a good indicator of when the worker was last seen active.
      This defaults to null in the database, and is set to the current time when the worker
      is first seen.
