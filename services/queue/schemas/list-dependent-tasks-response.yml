  Response from a `listDependentTasks` request.
type:               object
properties:
  taskId:
    title:          "Task Identifier"
    description: |
      Identifier for the task whose dependents are being listed.
    type:           string
    pattern:        {$const: slugid-pattern}
  tasks:
    type:           array
    title:          "Tasks that depends on `taskId`"
    description: |
      List of tasks that have `taskId` in the `task.dependencies` property.
    items:          {$ref: "http://schemas.taskcluster.net/queue/v1/task-definition-and-status.json#"}
  continuationToken:
    type:             string
    title:            "Continuation Token"
    description: |
      Opaque `continuationToken` to be given as query-string option to get the
      next set of dependent tasks.
      This property is only present if another request is necessary to fetch all
      results. In practice the next request with a `continuationToken` may not
      return additional results, but it can. Thus, you can only be sure to have
      all the results if you've called `listDependentTasks` with
      `continuationToken` until you get a result without a `continuationToken`.
