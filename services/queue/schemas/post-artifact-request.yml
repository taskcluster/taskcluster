    description: |
      Request the queue to redirect to a URL for a given artifact.
      This allows you to reference artifacts that aren't managed by the queue.
      The queue will still authenticate the request, so depending on the level
      of secrecy required, secret URLs **might** work. Note, this is mainly
      useful for public artifacts, for example temporary files directly
      stored on the worker host and only available there for a specific
      amount of time.
