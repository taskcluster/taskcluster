# Queue Service

This service is the central process coordinating execution of tasks in the Taskcluster setup.

## Development

No special configuration is required for development.

Run `yarn workspace taskcluster-queue test` to run the tests.
Some of the tests will be skipped without additional credentials, but it is fine to make a pull request as long as no tests fail.

To run _all_ tests, you will need appropriate Taskcluster credentials.
Using [taskcluster-cli](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-cli), run `eval $(taskcluster signin --scope assume:project:taskcluster:tests:taskcluster-queue)`, then run the tests again.

To run even more tests you'll need a configuration file with access credentials for S3 and postgres, as well as pulse credentials.
To do this, create a local configuration file `user-config.yml` in `services/queue`.
For safety reasons, this file is added to the `.gitignore` file.
There is an example `user-config-example.yml` to use for initial setup.

For S3 we have a dummy bucket called `test-bucket-for-any-garbage` which stores objects for 24 hours.
Mozilla developers can get access from a taskcluster developer, or you can setup a custom a bucket and overwrite the bucket name as well as the credentials.

## Queue internals

Queue service is using internal queues to manage task lifecycle. Those are:

- pending queue - scheduled tasks ready to be claimed
- claim queue - tasks that were claimed, and are awaiting to be resolved or failed with `claim-expired`
- deadline queue - task deadlines, to help resolve task graph dependencies if task was not resolved in time
- resolve queue - short-lived queue to resolve task graph dependencies

Interactions with those queues are handled in [`QueueService`](./src/queueservice.js).

### Create task

When task is created it can either be scheduled right away (no unmet dependencies) or it can stay unscheduled.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant client
  participant queue as Queue API
  participant pendingQueue as Pending Queue
  participant deadlineQueue as Deadline Queue

  client->>+queue: createTask()
  note over queue,deadlineQueue: track deadline resolution for task
  queue->>deadlineQueue: QueueService.putDeadlineMessage()
  note over queue,pendingQueue: if task can be scheduled already,<br> put it into pending queue
  queue->>pendingQueue: QueueService.putPendingMessage()

  queue->>-client: task status response
```

### Worker claiming work

Workers would be calling `queue.claimWork()` to get tasks from specific `taskQueueId`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant worker
  participant queue as Queue API
  participant workClaimer
  participant pendingQueue as Pending Queue
  participant claimQueue as Claim Queue
  participant claimResolver as Claim Resolver
  participant dependencyTracker as Dependency Tracker

  worker->>queue: claimWork()
  queue->>+workClaimer: WorkClaimer.claimTask(taskQueueId)
  workClaimer->>pendingQueue: QueueService.pollPendingQueue(taskQueueId)
  pendingQueue->>workClaimer: return 1 or more tasks
  workClaimer->>claimQueue: QueueService.putClaimMessage() <br> mark task as claimed<br> to check for expiration
  workClaimer->>-queue: tasks
  queue->>worker: tasks

  claimResolver-->>claimQueue: QueueService.pollClaimQueue()
  claimQueue-->>claimResolver: return expired claim messages
  claimResolver-->>claimResolver: ClaimResolver checks if task can be rescheduled

  alt task can be rerun
    claimResolver->>pendingQueue: QueueService.putPendingMessage()
  else task cannot be rerun
    claimResolver->>dependencyTracker: DependencyTracker.resolveTask()
  end

  note over worker, queue: for long running tasks,<br> worker should re-claim task
  worker->>queue: reclaimTask()
  queue->>claimQueue: QueueService.putClaimMessage()
  claimQueue->>claimQueue: `taken_until` is updated

```

### Tasks being resolved

Before task deadline, tasks can be resolved by calling `queue.reportCompleted()`, `queue.reportFailed()` or `queue.reportException()`.

`DependencyResolver` will be notified about resolved tasks and will try to resolve task graph dependencies.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant worker
  participant queue as Queue API
  participant claimQueue as Claim Queue
  participant resolveQueue as Resolved Queue

  worker-->>queue: reportCompleted() <br> reportFailed()
  queue-->>resolveQueue: QueueService.putResolvedMessage()
  queue-->>claimQueue: remove claim message

  dependencyResolver-->>resolveQueue: QueueService.pollResolvedMessage()
  resolveQueue-->>dependencyResolver: return zero or more tasks
  dependencyResolver-->>dependencyResolver: DependencyResolver.resolveTask()<br>Resolve Task Group or<br> schedule unblocked tasks

```
